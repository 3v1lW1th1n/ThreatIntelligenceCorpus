RFI List


Hi Folks, today just I wanna point out the RSnake's work on RFI list."I started on this project over a year ago, and then I stopped, and then I started it again, and then I stopped again, and finally today, I mostly got it finished (or as far as I’m willing to take it for today). I wanted to create a master list of a mess load of RFI (remote file include) attacks. I got the list from various sources and I’m sure I’m missing a ton so yes, if you think there’s some I’ve missed, go ahead and forward them on to me and I’ll add them in.You can download the full list here (1002 RFIs at the time of writing).But because of how I built this it’s got a few issues. The first one is that it doesn’t take into account the path to the vulnerable function. So if it’s http://www.vulnerable.com/bob/something… you have to add that in. The second issue is that sometimes the trailing question mark is needed but it’s not added in the string. But you may require the additional question mark so that you don’t get /r57.txt.somegarbage but rather /r57.txt?.somegarbage which will work. So if you use this, you may have to add in your own question marks after your RFI URL. Anyway, thoughts are welcome, and big thanks for the hundreds of people who found these in the first place! "Here you can download the whole Remote File Inclusion List. Well, it is a great list... but How can I use this ? Maybe someone has already translated it into something useful ?
