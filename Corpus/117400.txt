Latest Chrome Update Addresses Two High-Severity Vulnerabilities
Google on Wednesday pushed its third Chrome update since the beginning of March, patching a pair of high-severity vulnerabilities in the browser.
Yesterday’s update brings Chrome to version 50.0.2662.75 and patched 20 vulnerabilities, according to the Google Chrome Releases blog.
Eight of the bugs qualified for a reward under Google’s bug bounty program, the remaining dozen bugs were found internally.
Two of the flaws were rated “High” severity by Google: one was a cross-site scripting flaw credited to an unnamed researcher, and the other an out-of-bounds write flaw in V8 found by Choongwoo Han, a South Korean researcher and student at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The two bugs earned rewards of $7,500 and $5,000 respectively.
Following is a complete list of vulnerabilities that earned rewards:
