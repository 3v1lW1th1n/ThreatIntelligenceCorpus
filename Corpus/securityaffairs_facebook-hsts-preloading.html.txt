					Facebook improves link security infrastructure by implementing HSTS Preloading					
Facebook has upgraded its link security infrastructure to include HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preloading that instructs a browser to always use SSL/TLS to communicate with eligible websites.
Facebook and Instagram links will automatically update from HTTP to HTTPS for eligible websites.
“We have recently upgraded our link security infrastructure to include HSTS preloading, which automatically upgrades HTTP links to HTTPS for eligible websites. This will improve people’s security and will also often improve the speed of navigation to sites from Facebook.” reads the announcement published by Facebook.
Facebook determines the links that are eligible for HTTPS based on two sources:
Facebook invites websites to support HTTPs and sponsors Let’s Encrypt initiative which provides free TLS certificates and instructions on how to enable HTTPS for most common server software.
