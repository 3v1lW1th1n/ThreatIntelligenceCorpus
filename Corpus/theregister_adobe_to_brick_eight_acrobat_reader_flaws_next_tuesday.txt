Adobe to brick eight Acrobat, Reader flaws next Tuesday
Adobe will be brick over eight holes in a patch run next week.
Acrobat will receive the lion's share of fixes; these include Acrobat DC, Reader DC, and XI.
Adobe Reader X and XI will each receive a patch for versions 10.1.15 and 11.0.12 respectively.
All patches apply to Windows and Mac offerings.
The advanced notification of the fixes does not elaborate on the vulnerabilities given that doing so will help attackers brew exploits ahead of patch time, but it does award a 'critical' severity rating of two that indicates each bug is likely to be exploited when those details drop.
It will be a busy Tuesday (or Antipodean Wednesday) for system administrators since Redmond is also scheduled to drop its monthly load of patches on the same day.
Last month Adobe dumped nearly two dozen fixes on enterprise lawns of which 16 led to code execution.
That lot addressed code execution flaws resulting from buffer overflow vulnerabilities, memory corruption, and stack and stack overflow corruption. ®
