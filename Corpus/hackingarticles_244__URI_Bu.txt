Hacking Windows PC with Sun Java JRE get Sound bank file:// URI Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a flaw in the getSoundbank function in the Sun JVM. The payload is serialized and passed to the applet via PARAM tags. It must be a native payload. The effected Java versions are JDK and JRE 6 Update 16 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 21 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_23 and earlier, and SDK and JRE 1.3.1_26 and earlier. NOTE: Although all of the above versions are reportedly vulnerable, only 1.6.0_u11 and 1.6.0_u16 on Windows XP SP3 were tested.
Java 6 Update 16
Windows XP service pack 2
Windows XP service pack 3
