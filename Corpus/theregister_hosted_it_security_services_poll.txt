Hosted security: necessary, evil or necessary evil?
Mini Poll From previous conversations with Reg readers, we know that security is something that is often best left to others – many organisations lack either the expertise or the time to really do justice to securing their IT systems. One possible answer is to get others to manage it – for example, by using hosted security services from third parties.
But do such facilities actually deal with the issues, and what guides the decision making between keeping security capabilities in house, versus using their hosted equivalents? What’s your take – and would you have any guidance for others? Put the kettle on and you’ll have finished our poll before you even settle down for that cuppa. As ever, we’ll be feeding back the results sharpish.
