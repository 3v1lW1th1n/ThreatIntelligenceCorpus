Live View


Hello Folks,after some hard working days on Electronic Voting Machines (uVote by CINECA) I want to present one of my best forensic friends: Live View.Live View is a Java-based graphical forensics tool that creates a VMware virtual machine out of a raw (dd-style) disk image or physical disk. This allows the forensic examiner to "boot up" the image or disk and gain an interactive, user-level perspective of the environment, all without modifying the underlying image or disk. Because all changes made to the disk are written to a separate file, the examiner can instantly revert all of his or her changes back to the original pristine state of the disk. The end result is that one need not create extra "throw away" copies of the disk or image to create the virtual machine.The software is based on 2 simple steps:1) Configure your program, this means where to carve information (from phisical Disk of from ISO)2) Run the result into VMWare.You will run your accused system.
