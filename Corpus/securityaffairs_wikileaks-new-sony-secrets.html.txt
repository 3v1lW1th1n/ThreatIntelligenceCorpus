WikiLeaks added more 276,394 documents to its search page, these documents were acquired when the alleged group of North Korean hackers GOP hacked the Sony network.
The first documents were published by WikiLeaks in April, and at the time 30,000 documents were made publicly available. At the time WikiLeaks stated:
“The emails show the back and forth on lobbying and political efforts, not only with the MPAA but with politicians directly,” and where was found “… connections and alignments between Sony Pictures Entertainment and the US Democratic Party”, “ SPE’s development of its own films and collecting ‘intelligence’ on rival pictures, for example documents in the archive reveal the budget breakdown for Oliver Stone’s rival picture Snowden, which is currently in production.”
The popular editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange said “This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation. It is newsworthy and at the centre of a geo-political conflict.” 
Now with this new released maybe we can find more about the lobbys and political associations inside the Sony corporation.


I did some search (one example in the image below) and I haven’t find nothing that could be incriminating or shocking
Never the less if you have the time to check some of the information available because can be interesting to understand how Sony works.
The experts expect that a new wave of sensitive documents will be soon published, meantime enjoy the interesting material.
