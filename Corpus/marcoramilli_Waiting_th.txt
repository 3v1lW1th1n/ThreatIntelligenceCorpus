Waiting the new iPhone.


Today during WWDC Apple is going to present the new iPhone, and the "new" Steve :D (hopefully). As many of you knows I am a big iPhone "fan" for such reason I point out this auto-refreshing page  where all the interested people might follow up the step by step event.So far:It is 6am EST...nothing exciting to report yet... Wait. Coffee is better than usual....that is a good sign.
