As result of the attack, the exchange suspended its service, below the tweet sent by the company that confirms that its server was hacked by attackers.
Dear users, we have reason to believe that there had been malicious attacks that temporarily gained access to @etherdelta https://t.co/NnqU5Er4rj DNS server. We are investigating this issue right now – in the meantime please DONOT use the current site.

The attackers spoofed EtherDelta’s domain to trick users into sending money.
“At least 308 ETH ($266,789) were stolen, as well as a large number of tokens potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.” reported Mashable.
EtherDelta posted another tweet to warn its users and explain that the impostor’s app had no chat button on the navigation bar, nor did it have an official Twitter feed on the bottom right. EtherDelta advised all users not to use the site.
 2/2 *BE AWARE* The imposer's app has no CHAT button on the navigation bar nor the offical Twitter Feed on the bottom right. It is also populated with a fake order book.

On Dec. 22, the service was fully restored. The company clarified that users using the MetaMask or hardware wallet on EtherDelta were not affected by the attack, also users that had never imported their private key on the imposer’s phishing site are safe.

Recently another cryptocurrency exchange, the South Korean Youbit has gone bankrupt after suffering a major cyber attack for the second time this year.
Earlies December, the cryptocurrency mining market NiceHash confirmed it has fallen victim to a hacking attack that resulted in the loss of $60m worth of Bitcoin.
The EtherDelta hack is emblematic, even if EtherDelta is supposed to be decentralized the attack against its website caused serious problems to the company operations.
