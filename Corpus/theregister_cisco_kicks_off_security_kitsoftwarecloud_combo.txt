Cisco kicks off security kit/software/cloud combo
Cisco has added threat management to its portfolio, announcing Managed Threat Defense which it says brings realtime security to its customers.
Since “cloud everywhere” is the base assumption of practically every new launch, the Borg feels constrained to stipulate that Managed Threat Defense includes an “on-premise” solution, meaning there's a box you can drop on your foot. It includes hardware, software and analytics (which The Register supposes are also software).
The customer-side kit is supported by Cisco's security operations centres, which monitor the service and provide “incident response analysis, escalation, and remediation recommendations”, the company says.
Cisco says the MTD telemetry helps protect against unknown threats, and its use of Hadoop makes the system fully big-data compliant, allowing the system to identify anomalous traffic from a customer's network.
Other Cisco technologies in the solution include Cisco's Advanced Malware Protection, Sourcefire's FirePOWER for threat detection, and Cisco Cloud Web Security for email and Web filtering.
The customer's subscription includes incident tracking and reporting.
“Managed Threat Defense uses machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to detect possible threats in real-time. This approach assumes the cyber-attacks today will not look like those yesterday, and employs heuristics designed to spot anomalous traffic patterns,” Cisco's SVP for security solutions Bryan Palma blogs here.
Currently, the service is offered in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. ®
