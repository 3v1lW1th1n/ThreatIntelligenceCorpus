Cyveillance Weekly Phishing Report – November 3, 2015
 
Week of October 25 – 31, 2015
Author: Robert McDaniel

 
In this week’s phishing activity report, we saw a negligible decrease in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Financial Services (>110%) saw the greatest increases in phishing activity last week.  While drops in Transportation (>25%) and Banking (>25%) phishing attempts helped counteract the increases in the aforementioned industry.

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
