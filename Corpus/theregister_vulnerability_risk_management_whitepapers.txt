Why conventional protection fails against web threats
And so to the Reg whitepaper library to inspect some security pitches. Here's a couple we thought deserved a wider airing.

Web threats: Why conventional protection doesn't work

This white paper from Trend Micro describes web threats, how they function, and their impacts. The paper argues that conventional security practices cannot cope with today's "blended techniques, an explosion of variants, and targeted regional attacks often based on social engineering to defraud users".
Trend calls for a "multi-layered, comprehensive set of techniques" - to ensure security, regulatory compliance, and business continuity. Sure enough, the IT security firm has its own version of this, the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network,. This is a "new type of security model that marries a lightweight desktop agent to Trend’s vast network-based resources in the cloud". An interesting read, nevertheless.

Seven essential steps to achieve, measure and prove optimal security risk reduction

This Qualys white paper also bangs on the security and the regulatory compliance drum. Rapid technology changes, new server and software deployments, and more sophisticated attack methods create the "greatest set of challenges faced by security and IT administrators trying to keep their systems secure and within regulatory compliance".
Sound similar to the Trend pitch? Qualys has a different take on how to keep the barbarian hordes at the gates. Noting that it is "impossible to secure what isn’t measured", the company advocates that organisation adopt sustainable vulnerability and risk management programs. These can identify real-world security threats and evaluate your organization’s ability to respond and quantify security progress to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of business data and networks. Without an accurate depiction of your network, there’s "no way to improve, let alone understand, the true security posture of your infrastructure".
In case you are wondering, "posture" is computer industry jargon for "strategy" or "plan". ®
