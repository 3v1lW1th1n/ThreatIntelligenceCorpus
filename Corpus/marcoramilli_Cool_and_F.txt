Here the link .What you need to edit to fit it in your system are the following lines (click on images to make they bigger):And if you wish to modify the file name you have to change these other lines (click on images to make they bigger):I've used it a couple of time and it works fine under windows systems. If you wanna a more professional keylogger you may modify this code just a little to obtaining great results.
