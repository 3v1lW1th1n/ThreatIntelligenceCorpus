The state government websites publicly displayed personal details such as names and addresses of Aadhaar users.
The Aadhaar system is the world’s largest biometric ID system, with over 1.123 billion enrolled members as of 28 February 2017.

The Aadhaar issuing body confirmed that the data was removed from the websites just after the data breach was noticed, but it did provide further details on the alleged hack.
Even if the UIDAI never publicly disclosed Aadhaar details public, more than 200 websites of central government and state government departments, were displaying the list of beneficiaries along with their name, address, other details and Aadhaar numbers.
“Though the UIDAI never made Aadhaar details public, 210 websites of central government and state government departments including educational institutes were displaying the list of beneficiaries along with their name, address, other details and Aadhaar numbers of general public.” reported the IndiaToday website.
