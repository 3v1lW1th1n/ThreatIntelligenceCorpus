Apple is revealing a series of improvement for its new iOS 9, today we have discussed the content blocker announced by Apple, and the company now announced new measures to improve the security of its devices.
The iOS9 will substitute the 4-digit passcodes to 6-digit passcodes increasing the number of possible combinations and making more difficult a brute-force attack.

iOS 9 also implements a two-factor authentication mechanism for users that log into their Apple account from their new device or browser. Apple sends them a verification code to their phone or displayed on their other Apple devices, with this 2FA scheme users can confirm their identity avoiding that hackers can try to access their account from an unknown device.
This new two-factor authentication method is triggered every time a user attempts to log in from an unknown device.
The iOS 9 users will also have the option “Don’t Allow” when receiving pop-up window appears or the text message.
Apple will release iOS 9 in the last quarter of 2015.
