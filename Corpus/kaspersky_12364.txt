How you can make the Internet more secure — and get Kaspersky Internet Security free
Access to the account of any user is a matter of interest for hackers. Even if the owners have never shared their credit card numbers or PINs in direct messages, the account can be used for other frauds: to send spam and viruses or to steal victims’ friends’ money. That’s why you should make sure the PCs of your relatives and friends are protected as thoroughly as your own devices are.
Sometimes your friends’ security depends on you as much as on them. Fortunately, Kaspersky Lab has the solution. Users from Brazil, Germany, France, India, Italy, Latin America, South Africa, and Turkey can take part in our Protect a Friend promotion. Join the program to share a reliable security solution with your friends and get a free 180-day license for Kaspersky Internet Security — Multi-Device.
To take part, just join My Kaspersky (it won’t take more than a minute), copy an affiliate link from your profile, and share it with friends in direct messages (or post it on your social network page). A small bonus: Licenses received from friends last longer by half than our standard trial version — they can use it for 45 days.
