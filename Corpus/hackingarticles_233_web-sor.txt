web-sorrow – A Remote Web Scanner for Version Detection, Misconfiguration, and Server Enumeration

web-sorrow is a PERL based tool used for checking a Web server for misconfiguration, version detection, enumeration, and server information. It is NOT a vulnerability scanner, inspection proxy, DDoS tool or an exploitation framework.
 To download the latest version click here and unzip it, 
Unzip Wsorrow_v1.3.6.zip
To run the script runs this command:
perl Wsorrow.pl

-S – stands for standard. a set of Standard tests and includes: indexing of directories testing, banner grabbing, language detection (should be obvious), robots.txt, and 200 response testing (some servers send a 200 ok for every req)
-auth – looks for login pages with a list of some of the most common login files and dirs and admin consoles. don’t need to be very big list of URLs because what else are going to name it? notAlogin.php???
-Cp – scan with a huge list of plugins dirs. the list is a bit old (2010)
-I – searches the responses for interesting strings
-Ws – looks for web services such as hosting provider, blogging services, favicon fingerprinting, and cms version info
-Fd – look for generally things people don’t want you to see. The list is generated form a TON of robot.txt so whatever it finds should be interesting.
-Fp – Fingerprint server based on behavior (unrefined as of yet)
-ninja – A light weight and undetectable scan that uses bits and peaces from other scans
-Sd – Bruteforce Sub Domains
-Db – Bruteforce Directories with the big dirbuster Database
-ua – use a custom UserAgent. PUT UA IN QUOTES if theres spaces
-proxy – send all http reqs via a proxy. example: 255.255.255.254:8080
-e – run all the scans in the tool
web-sorrow also has false positives checking on most of it’s requests (it pretty accurate but not perfect) 
basic: perl Wsorrow.pl -host scanme.nmap.org -S
look for login pages: perl Wsorrow.pl -host 192.168.1.1 -auth
CMS intense scan: perl Wsorrow.pl -host 192.168.1.1 -Ws -Cp all -I
most intense scan possible: perl Wsorrow.pl -host 192.168.1.1 -e -ua “I come in peace”
