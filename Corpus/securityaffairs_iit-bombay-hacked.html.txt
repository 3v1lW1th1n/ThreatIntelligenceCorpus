Cryptolulz666 is back, now he hacked the Indian Institute of Technology – IIT Bombay, one of the best Indian colleges, that has a current world rank of 200.
The hacker broke into the database of the college and leaked on Pastebin its database containing 54 tables.
The hacker told me to have used Blind SQL Injection attack, he sent an email to the admins, but he did not receive any response yet.
The motivation of the hack is the intent of creating awareness of cyber security. It is curious that one of the Top 200 colleges of the world has a so low level of security.

Cryptolulz666 also told me that the site of the IIT Bombay is also affected by a cross-site scripting flaw.
Cryptolulz666 told me that this attack has a special meaning for him.
“I am an Indian guy passionate about cyber security. This hack is very important for me because I spent my entire life in dreaming to be accepted at the IIT Bombay.
I’m so young, but I was enough skilled to broke into one of the most prestigious college in India and all over the world.” Cryptolulz666 told me.
This week Cryptolulz666 broke into the database of the website of Russian embassy of Armenia (www.embassyru.am) and leaked data. The hacker also launched DDoS attacks against a Russian and Italian Government websites.
