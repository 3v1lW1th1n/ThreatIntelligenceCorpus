The US-CERT/NIST is warning of the presence of a zero-day flaw that affects the Samsung FindMyMobile web service (CVE-2014-8346). The Samsung FindMyMobile implements several features that allow users to locate the lost device, to play an alert on a remote device or to lock remotely the mobile phone.
“The Remote Controls feature on Samsung mobile devices does not validate the source of lock-code data received over a network, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (screen locking with an arbitrary code) by triggering unexpected Find My Mobile network traffic.” states the security advisory issues by the NIST.
According to the NIST the Remote Controls feature implemented by the Samsung FindMyMobile fails to validate the sender of a lock-code data received over a network, an attacker could cause a denial of service remotely (screen locking with an arbitrary code) by triggering unexpected Find My Mobile network traffic.

The NIST rated the severity of the flaw in the Samsung FindMyMobile as HIGH, but the the exploitability subscore is 10.0, that is an index of the likelihood of exploitation.
