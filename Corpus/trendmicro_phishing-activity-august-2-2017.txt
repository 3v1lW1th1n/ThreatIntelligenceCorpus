Weekly Phishing Activity: August 2, 2017

This week, we saw a small decrease in overall phishing activity from the top 20 brands we monitor. The industries that saw decreases included, Internet and Information Services (>60%), Banking (>30%), and eCommerce (>30%).
The industries that experienced increases were: Electronic Payment Systems (>45%), Telecommunications (>30%), and Computer Software (>25%).
Additionally, we saw one change in which industries experienced phishing. This week, Dating Sites jumped back onto the list of top 20 industries we monitor.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
