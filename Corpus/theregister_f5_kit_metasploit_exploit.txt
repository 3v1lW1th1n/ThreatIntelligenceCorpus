Exploit posted for vulnerable F5 kit
A vulnerability in F5 kit first announced in February may be in the wild, with code posted to Github purporting to be an exploit.
The original advisory stated that vulnerable installations of F5’s BigIP and other systems allowed an attacker to log in as root, because the vulnerability exposed the device’s SSH private key. F5 responded earlier this month.
Since it’s only seven days since F5 issued its advisory – and the patch – it’s likely that unpatched systems still exist.
F5 describes the issue as “A platform-specific remote access vulnerability has been discovered that may allow a remote user to gain privileged access to affected systems using SSH. The vulnerability is caused by a configuration error, and is not the result of an underlying SSH defect.”
Today, exploit code has been posted to Github. That code purports to gain remote access to some of the affected F5 systems – its BigIP devices.
The vulnerability can be addressed either by users upgrading to a non-vulnerable version, or reconfiguring SSH access (instructions are provided at the F5 link).
The Register has sought comment from F5. ®
