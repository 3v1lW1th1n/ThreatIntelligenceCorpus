SPLITTERS! Symantec cleft in twain
The reports have been confirmed: Symantec CEO Michael Brown will split the unwieldy business into separate security and information management concerns, thus undoing the 2004 Veritas acquisition.
Brown has moved quickly after his confirmation in the role to lift the cleaver.
The San Andreas-style fault running through the heart of Symantec — security on one side and storage on the other — has proved impossible to stabilise, prompting the two sides to move apart.
Symantec will divide into two independent, publicly traded companies, with claims abounding of increased shareholder value, as each business will be able to:
The $4.2bn security business, to be called Symantec, will have Michael Brown as its CEO and president, and Thomas Seifert as its CFO.
The $2.5bn information management business has no name yet and features John Gannon as its general manager, not CEO, and Don Rath as the acting CFO. These two appointments suggest that formal CEO and CFO appointments will follow at a later date.

The security business will:
Our view is that both business will need to use M&A to get access to newer growth technologies in their respective areas.
The separation should complete by the end of 2015 and take the form of a free distribution of shares in the IM business to current Symantec shareholders. ®
