Presenting


Hi Folks,today I am going to present a new tool (at least for me) for presentation purposes, it 's called Prezi. Sometimes might happen that you got a very excellent idea, but since the way you are presenting-it is quite boring, the audience try to be distracted from the environment. The communication is a very important  step of you research, it should be  entertaining, direct and incisive. The  Prezi's concept is rather cool.  Instead of presenting information linearly over a series of slides, the information is actually all on one  whiteboard.  You then zoom in and zoom out to different elements and pan around. The goal is similar to Timeline 3D, your viewer always knows the context of the data, how it relates to other elements.  This makes it simpler for people to see and understand the big picture.
