Google pays $65k to shutter 23 Chrome bugs
Google has patched 42 vulnerabilities including 23 contributed by external researchers earning them US$65,000 (£54,030, A$83,732) in rewards.
The patches reported by external researchers cover nine high-, 10 medium- and four low- severity holes.
Half of the payouts went to prolific Polish pwner Mariusz Mlynski who scored US$30,000 (£27,015, A$41,866) for reporting four cross-origin bypasses in Chrome.
Researchers Rob Wu and Guang Gong picked up the two remaining top payments in the patch run landing US$7500 and US$4000 each for another cross-orgin bypass and a type confusion hole.
Wu collected additional bounties for medium- and low- severity holes pulling an extra $US4500.
"We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel," Google Chrome test engineer Krishna Govind says.
"Many of our security bugs are detected using AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, Control Flow Integrity or LibFuzzer." ®
