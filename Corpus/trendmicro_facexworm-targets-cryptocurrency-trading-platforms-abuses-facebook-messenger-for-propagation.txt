FacexWorm Targets Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms, Abuses Facebook Messenger for Propagation
Our Cyber Safety Solutions team identified a malicious Chrome extension we named FacexWorm, which uses a miscellany of techniques to target cryptocurrency trading platforms accessed on an affected browser and propagates via Facebook Messenger. A very small percentage of users were affected by these malicious extensions, and Chrome had already removed many of these extensions prior to being alerted by Trend Micro.
FacexWorm isn’t new. It was uncovered in August 2017, though its whys and hows were still unclear at the time. Last April 8, however, we noticed a spike in its activities that coincided with external reports of FacexWorm surfacing in Germany, Tunisia, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Spain.
Our analysis reveals FacexWorm’s capabilities were made over. It retains the routine of listing and sending socially engineered links to the friends of an affected Facebook account, just like Digmine. But now it can also steal accounts and credentials of FacexWorm’s websites of interest. It also redirects would-be victims to cryptocurrency scams, injects malicious mining codes on the webpage, redirects to the attacker’s referral link for cryptocurrency-related referral programs, and hijacks transactions in trading platforms and web wallets by replacing the recipient address with the attacker’s.
While we’ve so far only found one Bitcoin transaction compromised by FacexWorm when we checked the attacker’s address/wallet, we don’t know how much has been earned from the malicious web mining.

Propagation
FacexWorm is delivered through socially engineered links sent to Facebook Messenger. The links redirect to a fake YouTube page that will ask unwitting users to agree and install a codec extension (FacexWorm) in order to play the video on the page. It will then request privilege to access and change data on the opened website.

Once installed and granted permission, FacexWorm will download additional malicious codes from its command-and-control (C&C) server and open Facebook’s website. Once the extension detects that Facebook is open, it will communicate with its C&C server again to check if the propagation function is enabled.
If it is enabled, FacexWorm will request an OAuth access token from Facebook. It then performs a sequence of queries to Facebook to obtain the account’s friend list and sends fake YouTube video links again to contacts who are in online or idle status. When accessed through browsers other than Chrome’s desktop version, the malicious link will instead divert to a random advertisement.
Malicious Behaviors
FacexWorm is a clone of a normal Chrome extension but injected with short code containing its main routine. It downloads additional JavaScript code from the C&C server when the browser is opened. Every time a victim opens a new webpage, FacexWorm will query its C&C server to find and retrieve another JavaScript code (hosted on a Github repository) and execute its behaviors on that webpage.

Persistence Mechanism
FacexWorm implements a mechanism to deter victims from removing the malicious extension from the browser. If FacexWorm detects that the user is opening the Chrome extension management page via “chrome://extensions/”, it will immediately close the opened tab. This behavior of preventing users from accessing Chrome’s management page address is also employed by other malicious extensions such as the DroidClub botnet (although DroidClub doesn’t close the tab but instead replaces it with a fake management page).

Mitigation Methods
Although the attacker keeps trying to upload new FacexWorm extensions to the Chrome Web Store, we found that they are also punctually removed from the store. We also noticed that Facebook Messenger can detect the malicious, socially engineered links and duly blocks the propagation behavior of the affected account. Given FacexWorm’s routines and propagation technique, these actions help further mitigate its impact. Users should also practice good security habits to avoid falling for similar threats: Think before sharing, be more prudent against unsolicited or suspicious messages, and enable tighter privacy settings for your social media accounts.
We disclosed our findings to Facebook, with whom we have a proactive cybersecurity partnership. The company shared its efforts to fight threats like FacexWorm: “We maintain a number of automated systems to help stop harmful links and files from appearing on Facebook and in Messenger. If we suspect your computer is infected with malware, we will provide you with a free anti-virus scan from our trusted partners. We share tips on how to stay secure and links to these scanners on facebook.com/help.”
