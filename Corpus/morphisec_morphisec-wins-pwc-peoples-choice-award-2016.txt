Morphisec was honored to receive the PricewaterhouseCoopers People’s Choice Award at PwC Cyber Security Day 2016 in Luxembourg last week. (Read the full press release here.)
Award candidates were evaluated on value proposition, internationalization strategy, potential impact in the industry, as well as their elevator pitch performance made in front of 200 investors, corporations and industry experts.
"Morphisec convinced the audience because their solution is disrupting the endpoint signature-based antivirus protection with a totally new memory structure approach," explained Edouard Nollet, Senior Manager PwC's Accelerator. The award also includes a customized two-day workshop with PwC’s Accelerator program.
To be included in the Cyber Security Day program and competition was itself an honor. Morphisec was one of ten finalists selected out of more than one hundred start-ups that made the long list.
“We invited the ten most innovative companies in the global Cyber Security ecosystem which provide specific and innovative proven solutions to increasing and evolving cyber threats,” commented Laurent Probst, partner at PwC Luxembourg and Network Global Leader of PwC’s Accelerator.
