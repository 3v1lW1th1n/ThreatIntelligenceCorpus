					Malwarebytes is working hard to fix flaws in its antivirus					
The Antivirus firm Malwarebytes is spending a significant effort to fix serious vulnerabilities in its defense solution that was reported by the experts at the Google’s Project Zero team.
The experts at Project Zero discovered that updates for Malwarebytes Antivirus were not digitally signed or downloaded over a secure HTTP connection, opening the user to Man-In-The-Middle attacks. An attacker could manipulate the updates hacking the Antivirus solutions.
Google Project Zero reported the vulnerabilities to Malwarebytes in November, waiting for 90 days before publicly disclosing the vulnerability.

The experts at Malwarebytes were not able to solve the problem in the 90-day period, so the researcher Tavis Ormandy published the details of the security issue.
“Malwarebytes fetches their signature updates over HTTP, permitting a man-in-the-middle attack,” he explained in a blog post.
“Therefore, this scheme is not sufficient to prevent tampering, and the developer should sign them. There are numerous simple ways to turn this into code execution, such as specifying a target file in the network configuration, writing a new TXTREPLACE rule to modify configuration files, or modifying a registry key with a REPLACE rule.”
The Chief executive at MalwareBytes, Marcin Kleczynski, admitted the difficulties in solving the problem, preannouncing many other weeks to fix the problem.
“In early November, a well-known and respected security researcher by the name of Tavis Ormandy alerted us to several security vulnerabilities in the consumer version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. Within days, we were able to fix several of the vulnerabilities server-side and are now internally testing a new version (2.2.1) to release in the next 3-4 weeks to patch the additional client-side vulnerabilities. At this time, we are still triaging based on severity.” he said in a blog post. The research seems to indicate that an attacker could use some of the processes described to insert their own code onto a targeted machine. Based on the findings, we believe that this could only be done by targeting one machine at a time.” .
Kleczynski took the opportunity to launch the Malwarebytes Bug Bounty program which will help the company to early discover any flaw in their software and to “encourage other security researchers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in Malwarebytes software.”
“I’d also like to take this opportunity to apologise. While these things happen, they shouldn’t happen to our users.”
