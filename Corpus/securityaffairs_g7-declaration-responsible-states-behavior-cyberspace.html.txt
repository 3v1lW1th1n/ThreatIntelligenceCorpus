					G7 DECLARATION ON RESPONSIBLE STATES BEHAVIOR IN CYBERSPACE					
The risk of escalation and retaliation in cyberspace, the increasing number of cyber attacks and cyber threats even more sophisticated could have a destabilizing effect on international peace and security. The risk of conflict between states caused so cyber incidents encourages all States to engage in law-abiding, norm-respecting and confidence-building behavior in their use of ICT.

I’m very proud to share with you the G7 DECLARATION ON RESPONSIBLE STATES BEHAVIOR IN CYBERSPACE, I had the honor to be a member of the group that worked on the proposal for voluntary, non-binding norms of State behavior during peacetime. We presented 12 points aimed to propose stability and security in the cyberspace. The declaration invites all the States to collaborate with the intent to reduce risks to international peace, security, and stability.
Below the point presented in the Declaration:
Let me thank the colleagues Luigi Martino and Marco Lapadura that worked with me at the declaration, and of course to Minister Gianfranco Incarnato that led the group of work.
This is just a fist step of a long journey!
