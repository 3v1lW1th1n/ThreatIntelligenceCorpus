Weekly Phishing Activity: August 7, 2017

This week, we saw a substantial increase of (>85%) in overall phishing activity from the top 20 brands we monitor. The industries with the greatest increase in phishing activity included, Internet and Information Services (>760%), Storage and Systems Management Software (>280%), and Internet Search & Navigation Services (>280%).
Only two industries saw decreases: Electronic Payment Systems (>15%) and Telecommunications (>4%).
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
