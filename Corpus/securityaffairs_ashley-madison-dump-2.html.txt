A few hours ago, Joseph Cox, contributor at MotherBoard confirmed that the hackers behind the Ashley Madison data breach released a new dump of website database.
In the last days, 10GB of data apparently sourced from the adultery website Ashley Madison and its parent site Avid Life Media.
Now the hacking crew who named itself “Impact Team” has released another dump that is double in size respect the previous one. The new dump includes a message for the Avid Life Media’s CEO Noel Bidermanthat that states:
“Hey Noel, you can admit it’s real now,” 

The message was signed with the PGP key previously used by Impact Team, confirming that the message is genuine.
The message includes a new torrent file that links another dump of nearly 20GB of the Ashley Madison website. This new dump includes more internal data and also the Biderman’s emails (one compressed folder is called “noel.biderman.mail.7z”).

Motherboard is analyzing the files to discover if they are genuine.
Stay tuned!
