The hacking collective Anonymous launched the operation #OpParis against the ISIS in response to the dramatic Paris attacks. The hackers belonging to Anonymous are targeting social media accounts used by members of the terrorist organization. Anonymous released a video on the Internet announcing that his members will catch ISIS members online. In the video, an avatar of Anonymous with a strong French accent declared war to the terrorists

In a couple of days, more than five thousand Twitter account were brought down by Anonymous, as announced by the collective in Tweet.
“We report that more than 5500 Twitter account of #ISIS are now #down! #OpParis #Anonymous #ExpectUs,” states the tweet published by Anonymous on Tuesday.
It is not clear how Anonymous has taken down the Twitter accounts used by the ISIS. Anonymous said it posted the accounts to an online forum using the hashtag #daeshbags (Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group).

On the hacker side also the hackers belonging to the ISIS have released a statement in response to Anonymous’s #OpParis, the members of the ISIS called Anonymous – IDIOTS.
“The #Anonymous hackers threatened… that they will carry out a major hack operation on the Islamic state (idiots),” the message said.
The message was posted via the messaging service Telegram, the communication channel mostly used by the ISIS members in this period.

 
This is just the beginning, for sure in the next days the hackers will surprise us. Don’t forget that Anonymous is inviting its members to avoid to launch DDoS attacks against the ISIS websites, instead the collective is asking to hack them stealing sensitive data to disclose.
