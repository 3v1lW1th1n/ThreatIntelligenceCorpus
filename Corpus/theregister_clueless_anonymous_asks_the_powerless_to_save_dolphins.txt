Clueless Anonymous asks the powerless to save dolphins
Persons using the name and iconography of online activist collective “Anonymous” (PUTNAIOOACA) are appealing to recently-dethroned world leaders to help them in a fight against Japan's dolphin slaughter program.
PUTNAIOOACA operatives are currently running #opkillingbay, an effort to draw global attention to the annual dolphin hunt in the Japanese town of Taiji. #opkillingbay suggests nations boycott Tokyo's 2020 summer olympics over the hunt, apparently a bloody and cruel affair. There's also a health angle to the protest: dolphin's apparently very high in mercury.
The operation's seen PUTNAIOOACA peeps conduct DDOS attacks on Japanese airports and, over the weekend, use the same tactic to take down the web site of the nation's ministry of health.
Which is where El Reg started looking into the matter and found the @OpKillingBay twitter account.
That feed shouts out to world leaders about the Taiji dolphin hunt, urging them to work for its cessation.
But there's just one problem: some of the world leaders to whom PUTNAIOOACA pleads have recently lost their jobs.
The tweet below, for example, appears to be directed at Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper ... who lost his job after the nation's October 19th election. The account @pmharper no longer exists.
Another tweet calls out to former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who was voted out by his own party on September 14th.
While Abbott and Harper remain members of parliament, both have greatly diminished influence. If PUTNAIOOACA are serious about the cause, they really need to get up to speed and target @turnbullmalcom and @JustinTrudeau instead.
The PUTNAIOOACA operatives behind #opkillingbay do hit their targets with US president Barack Obama, UK prime minister David Cameron, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy Brey and Beverley Hills 90210 actress Shannen Doherty. ®
