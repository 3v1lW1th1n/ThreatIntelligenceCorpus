Android Malware Harvests Facebook Account Details
Recently, there have been reports of mobile threats stealing Facebook login credentials, such as user names and passwords. We’ve encountered new Android malware (detected as Android.Fakeapp) that takes a more aggressive approach: logging into Facebook accounts and harvesting account details directly from victims’ devices. The majority of the victims are located in the Asia-Pacific region.
The malware we’ve encountered was sourced from third-party markets. The apps target English speakers.
Once installed, the malicious app immediately hides itself from the home screen, leaving only a service running in the background. This service takes the following steps to steal details from a Facebook user’s account:
Using JavaScript from a hidden WebView, the threat silently logs into the compromised Facebook account. The malware hides the WebView by setting the display to be almost completely transparent (Figure 2).
It then ensures that a CAPTCHA isn’t presented. If it is, it sends the event to the C&C server, clears caches and cookies, and retries later.
Once the malware is logged into the Facebook page, it can leverage a wide range of capabilities to follow links and scrape the personal data of the victim and their friends, sending it back to the C&C server. This includes:
The functionality that crawls the Facebook page has a surprising level of sophistication. The crawler has the ability to use the search functionality on Facebook and collect the results. Additionally, to harvest information that is shown using dynamic web techniques, the crawler will scroll the page and pull content via Ajax calls (Figures 4 and 5).
