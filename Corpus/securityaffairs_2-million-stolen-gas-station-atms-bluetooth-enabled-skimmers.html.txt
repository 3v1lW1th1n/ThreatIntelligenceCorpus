Here we are again to write on another huge Credit Card theft that hit ATMs located at Gas Stations  in Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina. US prosecutors have charged 13 members of a criminal gang accused of stealing $2 million from customers,  the gang used a Bluetooth-enabled skimmers hidden inside pump ATMs.
The  Bluetooth-enabled skimmers used is an undetectable device are able to capture credit card data, this information were used to clone customers’ card  and use them to  draw cash  from ATMs in other states.
The skimmers were installed internally ATMs and was not detectable by visual inspection, criminals used Bluetooth channel to take the stolen card information. Be aware, the criminals captured also customers PIN from the gas pumps, the cloned card were used to withdraw money from the ATMs in New York. The criminals preferred to hit Gas Station ATMs, and not the bank ATMs, that are generally better protected.
Between March 2012 and March 2013, the gang has stolen $2.1 million from ATMs in California, Manhattan and Nevada, the criminals adopted the necessary precautions to avoid detection, for example making transaction under the $10,000 threshold used to trigger control fraud.

 
The criminals have spread the stolen amount in at least 70 different bank accounts to make harder its localization.
 If you do not take more security measures, such as the use of credit card based on a microchip, the risk to users can be greatly enhanced.
