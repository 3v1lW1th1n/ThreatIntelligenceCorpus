 git clone “url copied to clipboard”
Next, go to the directory of WiFi Pumpkin on the terminal. For eg. if the repo is downloaded to the Desktop, type:
cd Desktop/WiFi-Pumpkin
./installer.sh –install
Thereafter, run wifi-pumpkin:

This will open the gui version of WiFi-Pumpkin. Now select the network adapter and change the SSID from PumpAP and rename it as desired.

Thereafter click on the Start button. This will create a new wifi-zone with the name entered in the SSID field.

Now as soon as any device connects to this wifi network, its details will be shown in the table at the right. Select any target device from the list of connected device/s and select Active Driftnet from the Tools menu.  

As soon as Driftnet starts, it will start sending screenshots from the victim’s desktop/mobile. This will also capture the images of facebook.
