					Windows Analytics now includes Meltdown and Spectre detector					
Microsoft has added a Meltdown-and-Spectre detector to its telemetry analysis tool Windows Analytics. The Meltdown-and-Spectre detector was available since Tuesday when Microsoft announced the new capabilities implemented in the free Windows Analytics service. 
The new capabilities allow admin to monitor:
The check for the status of the Operating System could allow admins to verify if Meltdown and Spectre patched are correctly working.
The antivirus check allows admins to verify if the running AV is compatible with required Windows Operating System updates.
The check for firmware status currently works only for Intel chips.

Meltdown-and-Spectre detector is available for Windows 7 through Windows 10 and requires that systems are running the February 2018 patch levels (Win7 SP1, KB2952664; Win8.1, KB2976978; and for Win10, KB4033631).
