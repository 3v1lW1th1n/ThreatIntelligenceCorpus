Backdoored Litecoin Wallet Spread via Typosquatted DomainsOverviewCryptocurrencies are increasingly being used for mainstream applications, outside of the dark web markets where they still dominate for anonymous payments. As a result, we are observing phishing attacks and various schemes targeting cryptocurrency wallets and credentials for online exchanges more frequently, with cybercriminals hoping to steal significant sums of largely untraceable currency. The most recent of these targets the Litecoin platform, the popularity of which is increasing globally.AnalysisProofpoint researchers regularly monitor newly registered domains with particular attention to typosquatting and areas of emerging interest (like cryptocurrencies) for attackers. In this case, we noticed two interesting domains itecoin[.]org and ltecoin[.]org that were created and which appeared to be clones of the legitimate site litecoin.org.Figure 1: Legitimate Litecoin.orgFigure 2: Imposter website ltecoin[.]org with stolen branding and creativeThe websites do not share the same hosting. DNS information is shown below for both domains: Whois information for the typosquatted ltecoin[.]org appears very suspicious: The registrant also recently registered krken.com, likely soon to be a phishing site for the Kraken Bitcoin Exchange, kraken.com.As on the legitimate Litecoin site, users are presented with the option of downloading wallet software from the ltecoin[.]org homepage. When they click the download button, users are presented with a binary, litecoin-0.13.2-win64-setup.exe.Figure 3: Backdoored Litecoin wallet downloaded from imposter site itecoin[.]orgThis is not the wallet software we are expecting based on the comparison of the MD5 hashes for both the legitimate current version of the Litecoin wallet and the version from the typosquatted domain. The backdoored Litecoin binary contains an extra file, plugins.exe. The legitimate contents of the Litecoin wallet installer are on the right.Figure 4: Comparison of the contents of the backdoored (left) and legitimate (right) litecoin wallet programs.The MD5 hash for the plugins.exe file is shown below: Upon execution, the file extracts a resource, decodes it and writes to the startup folder as winsvc.exe, and launches. The launcher (plugins.exe) is deleted.Figure 5: Encoded file ‘BARGAINWEDDING’ as a resource in the ‘plugins.exe’ dropper.Figure 6 shows the newly installed winsvc.exe executing from the startup folder. Winsvc.exe is actually a keylogger.Figure 6: The keylogger executing from the startup folder.Upon execution after a sleep, the malware makes an HTTP POST to the command and control (C&C) and send HTML-formatted scraped keylogs and a screenshot of the infected user’s desktop.Figure 7: HTTP POST to the keylogger C&CDNS information for the C&C is shown below: The keylogger has been in use for some time and likely goes by the name ‘XKey’. It is fairly well detected according to VirusTotal and has been seen utilized in other incidents.ConclusionAs the use of cryptocurrencies becomes more commonplace, so too will attacks involving the underlying platforms and technologies. Traditional bank credential theft remains extremely common and banking Trojans designed to steal credentials and facilitate fraudulent transactions are frequent payloads in both email and web-based attacks. As always, though, threat actors follow the money as well as the easiest paths to profit, making cryptocurrencies increasingly attractive targets.We immediately notified the hosting company (Namecheap) about the imposter websites but the sites have not been taken down as of July 26, 2017.ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Coverage
