Cisco dices engineering into four: Security, IoT, cloud and networking
Cisco boss Chuck Robbins has reshuffled his engineering operations as the IT giant continues to remake itself with a focus on software-defined networking and services.
Robbins broke the news to employees with a memo on Monday.
"Yesterday Cisco announced changes within Engineering designed to better reflect our strategic priorities and align around four growth areas," a Cisco spokesperson told The Register. "These changes reflect the company’s focus on moving quickly to meet customers’ needs as they embrace digital transformation.”
The changes will see Cisco engineering divided into four distinct units: security; IoT and applications; cloud services and platforms; and networking. All four of the units' bosses will report directly to Robbins as part of the executive leadership team.
CTO Zorawar Biri Singh is taking over the cloud services and platforms operations. A veteran in cloud since his days at HP, Singh has been taking an active role in pushing Cisco's cloud gear even before the announcement.
The security branch will be run by David Goeckeler, who has been running Cisco's security operations under the Security Business Group banner. Rowan Trollope will be charged with running the IoT and Applications business, including the team from the newly acquired Jasper.
The move will also include some departures. Pankaj Patel, who was known to be leaving the company, will help establish the Networking Market Segments and Solutions operation before he exits. Service Provider business senior vice president Kelly Ahuja will also depart.
The shakeup should be seen as the latest step in Robbins' effort to make Cisco his own since taking over from John Chambers last year. His ongoing process has included moves to refocus Cisco around new areas including IoT and services. ®
