Towards a practical and effective security testing methodology


Hi Folks,I would like to invite you to ISCC 2010 IEEE conference in Italy (22 to 25 of June). The conference will be placed in Riccione, Italy. Friends of mine told me it will be very interesting since there are a lots of important "Keynote Speakers". Marco Prandini and I will present "Toward a practical and effective security testing methodology", here the abstract:Abstractâ€”Security testing is an important step in the lifetimeof both newly-designed and existing systems. Differentmethodologies exist to guide testers to the selection, design,and implementation of the most appropriate testing proceduresfor various contexts. Typically, each methodology stems fromthe specific needs of a particular category of actors, and consequentlyis biased towards some aspect of peculiar interest. Thiswork compares the most commonly adopted methodologiesto point out their strengths and weaknesses, and, buildingon the results of the performed analysis, proposes a pathtowards the definition of an integrated approach, by definingthe characteristics that a new methodology should exhibit inorder to combine the best aspects of the existing ones.If you are planning to come let me know we will organize something fun together !
