					Azerbaijani Anti-Armenia Team of hacktivists leaked Armenian security service data					
A group of Azerbaijani hacktivists has leaked the passport details of foreign visitors to Armenia.
The data breach exposed the Internal resources of the Security Service (SNS) that are involved in the process of updating information about passports of foreign passports.
The hackers breached Armenian government servers stealing sensitive data, including passport scans. Intelligence experts who analyzed the data leaks confirmed their authenticity.
The Anti-Armenia Team took credit for a series of data leaks that the hackers claim were stolen from servers of Armenian national security ministry.
“We would like to notice that Anti – Armenia team is an independent group, who is active for five years and repeatedly makes anxious Armenian side by its cyber attacks,” the group explained to El Reg.
Armenia and Azerbaijan are neighbouring countries that engaged a war over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region between 1988 and 1994.
There is a great tension between the two countries, in April, the Azerbaijani army tried to regain control of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, but the battle caused the death of 350 people.

A source that has spoken to El Reg on condition of anonymity told to El Reg the leaked information is more likely to have come from an insider, excluding that the alleged Anti–Armenia team has hacked on Armenian government systems.
“I am familiar with the incident, and [can] confirm, that such attacks really happened, and the documents are legitimate and not fake,” the source told el Reg. “I have more confidence that one of their employees having access to it has been compromised and technical border control service is a part of SNS (Security Service), that’s why there is such overlap, and the documents could be stolen from particular person, and not ‘systems’, like they claim.”
