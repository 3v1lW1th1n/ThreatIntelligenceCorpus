Chinese bit-squatter information thieves dupe Taiwan Govt site
China-based hackers have been fingered for bit-squatting attacks against Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, FireEye researchers say.
The attackers replicated the DPP website on a malicious domain in a bid to glean information about visitors.
The presence of payloads or specific techniques was not detailed in the CNN report.
Attacks lasted several days last month and follow the inauguration of President Tsai Ing-wen.
FireEye identified China's so-called APT16 attack group for attacks against the DPP in December.
"FireEye believes this operation likely reflects continued efforts by China-based cyber espionage operators to collect intelligence related to the DPP as it moves Taiwan away from pro-mainland China policies," FireEye researchers say.
The mainland has long been subject to white hat research with dozens of reports blaming state based and patriotic groups for attacks against minority groups, rival nations, and major private sector organisations.
Concrete attribution however is difficult for groups with solid operational security skills. ®
