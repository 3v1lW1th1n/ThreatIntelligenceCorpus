“All computer products are not allowed to install [the] Windows 8 operating system,” reads the post on the center’s website.

“We were surprised to learn about the reference to Windows 8 in this notice,” “Microsoft has been working proactively with the Central Government Procurement Center and other government agencies through the evaluation process to ensure that our products and services meet all government procurement requirements.” “We have been and will continue to provide Windows 7 to government customers. At the same time we are working on the Window 8 evaluation with relevant government agencies,” reported Microsoft.
