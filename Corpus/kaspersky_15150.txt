Ask us anything — really
The threat landscape is ever changing and our Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) is constantly looking at new attacks and finding ways to help protect the world from attack. No matter what time it is in the world, some of our GReAT researchers are working to expose the most sophisticated threats and keep the world safe. You see, cybercriminals don’t sleep — and neither does GReAT.
Have you ever wondered what magic GReAT members use? How they do what they do? If they use free Wi-Fi? Or have any hobbies?
 
 
Well now is your chance. On Wednesday, July 27, at 9:00 EDT (add to your calendar), four members of GReAT will log into Reddit and peel back the onion a bit in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. The group fielding questions will include Costin Raiu, Vicente Diaz, Vitaly Kamluk, and Ryan Naraine.
UPD: The AMA session is now live! Join us at https://kas.pr/AskGReAT.
The team will be answering questions for about one and a half hours and will try to get to as many as they can. We’ll share the link on our company’s social media accounts and will tag some of the best questions and answers using #AskGReAT.
Ask us literally anything #AskGReAT #AMA
