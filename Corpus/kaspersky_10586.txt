Tip of the Week: Trouble shooting Protected Browser
We’ve previously published a post about the Safe Money component in Kaspersky Internet Security. Today we are going to cover what to do when the Protected Browser’s frame changes its color to orange and what you should do to make it green again.
Here are the most common cases.
In this case you should install the Kaspersky Protection extension for Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.
You should turn the automatic update on in the Windows Update. It’s very important to update your OS on the regular basis. This measure helps to protect you from criminals when they try to use known vulnerabilities to infect your computer.
To turn it on in Kaspersky Internet Security, open the Settings window, choose the Protection tab and switch on the Application Control component.
