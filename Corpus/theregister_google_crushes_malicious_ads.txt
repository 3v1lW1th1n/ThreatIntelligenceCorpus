That one weird trick fails: Google binned 780 million ads last year
Google blocked 780 million malicious and annoying advertisements last year, up from 256 million in 2014.
The company says it has destroyed more than 10,000 sites foisting software like download wrappers, which install adware and the like. This, it says, reduced the total unwanted downloads through Google ads by 99 percent.
Mountain View says it has also blocked more than 100,000 counterfeit web sites and 18,000 Google accounts, junked 7,000 phishing sites, and binned some 12.5 million pharmaceutical ads.
The Chocolate Factory has no time for fringe medicine, blocking more than 30,000 sites pushing rubbish weight loss claims.
All blocked sites and accounts have increased since last year. Ad and commerce boss Sridhar Ramaswamy says Google employs more than 1,000 staff in its fight against malicious advertisements.
"Last year alone we disabled more than 780 million ads for violating our policies – a number that's increased over the years thanks to new protections we've put in place," Ramaswamy says.
"We're always updating our technology and our policies based on your feedback – and working to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters." ®
