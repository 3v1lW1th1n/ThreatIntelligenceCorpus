“I found a CSRF vulnerability in Avira can lead me to full account takeover of any Avira user account,” Gamal said via an email to The Hacker News. “The impact of the account takeover allowed me to Open the Backup files of the victim and also view the license codes for the affected user.”

Gamal has reported the vulnerability to the Avira Security Team on August 21th, the team admitted the flaw and fixed the CSRF bug on their website, but the Secure online backup service “is still vulnerable to hackers until Avira will not offer a offline password layer for decrypting files locally.”
Mazen Gamal has been recognized as an official bug hunter by Avira.
