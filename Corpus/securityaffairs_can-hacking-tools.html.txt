The high level of technological penetration into the objects that surround  us, is making life more comfortable, but is enlarging our surface of attack. Paradigms like the Internet of Things promises miracles, but also open the door to new opportunity for the hacking community.
The security researchers Javier Vazquez-Vidal and Alberto Garcia Illera have designed a kit to hack a car made up of a tiny device smaller than your Smartphone, they called it CAN Hacking Tools (CHT) and they will present it at the Black Hat Asia security conference in Singapore next month.

Hack a ‘car has never been so easy and cheaper, the Kit costs less than $20, but is far capable to take away car’s entire control from windows and headlights to its steering and brakes.
“small gadget they built for less than $20 that can be physically connected to a car’s internal network to inject malicious commands affecting everything from its windows and headlights to its steering and brakes. ” reported Forbes.
“It can take five minutes or less to hook it up and then walk away,” “We could wait one minute or one year, and then trigger it to do whatever we have programmed it to do.” says Vazquez Vidal.
