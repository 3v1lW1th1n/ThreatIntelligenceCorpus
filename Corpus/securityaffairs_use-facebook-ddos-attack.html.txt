Facebook servers are forced to download 1 MB  of file 1000 times in one page view (It has been estimated that each note is now responsible for 1000+ http requests).  If 100 Facebook users are reading the same note at the same time, then Facebook servers will be forced to download 1 x 1000 x 100 = 100,000 Mb or 97.65Gb bandwidth within few seconds from the targeted servers. In the image below is reported the graph for the 400 Mbps traffic generated from 127 Facebook servers in the proof-of-concept made by Thapa by attacking on his own web server.

Following the description provided in the post by the Chaman Thapa.
Steps to re-create the bug as reported to Facebook Bug Bounty on March 03, 2014. Step 1. Create a list of unique img tags as one tag is crawled only once
Step 2. Use m.facebook.com to create the notes. It silently truncates the notes to a fixed length.
Step 3. Create several notes from the same user or different user. Each note is now responsible for 1000+ http request.
Step 4. View all the notes at the same time. The target server is observed to have massive http get flood. Thousands of get request are sent to a single server in a couple of seconds. Total number of facebook servers accessing in parallel is 100+.
