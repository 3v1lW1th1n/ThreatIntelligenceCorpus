Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at the Israeli Dealmakers Summit in Silicon Valley. With over a thousand of the world’s top corporations, investors and entrepreneurs, it’s known as the largest and most prestigious Israel-focused business event. While it was exciting to participate, the real privilege was to be able to help showcase the innovative ideas and technology coming out of Israel.
In the event’s spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration, my presentation focused on explaining the current state of cybersecurity with an in-depth explanation of moving target defense both as a general concept and how we at Morphisec apply it to cybersecurity. Given the mixed nature of the audience – both technical and non-technical folk – I kept it light on engineering-speak. Enjoy the video to learn more about moving target defense.
