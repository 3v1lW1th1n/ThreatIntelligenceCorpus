AVG buys remote monitoring player LPI Level Platforms
Security biz AVG has put its hand in its pocket to buy remote monitoring and management (RMM) software player LPI Level Platforms as it tries to appeal to a wider bunch of channel firms.
AVG shifted all its wares into the cloud late autumn and to date has signed up just 1,500 of the 5,000 channel partners it has in the UK and North America. The firm has 10,000 partners globally.
Around a 1,000 partners had signed up by February.
Mike Foreman, SME general manager at AVG, said he was "pleased" with the partner recruitment but was upping activity using demos, webinars and other events to raise numbers.
On the Level Platforms buy, he argued rivals could not integrate a management and security tech into a single platform.
"They can do piecemeal parts of the puzzle but none of them has a unified platform around AV, RMM and filtering aimed at small businesses," he told The Channel.
The deal was for an unspecified amount, and AVG's chief finance people will outline the price at the next earning conference call with financial analysts.
Foreman expects more service providers/ resellers/ integrators to sign up to its online system CloudCare when customers come to renew current security tech.
Level Platforms currently works with 1,500 active channel partners, said CEO Peter Sandiford, who said he intends to remain very hands on with the operation.
He said security is "invariably tied in with the purchase" of RMM and Mobile Device Management so the businesses come from "different directions" but will be a neat fit, at least that is what he expects.
AVG forecast $5m worth of subscription revenues related to the Level Platforms acquisition in the second half of 2013, and to grow to $15m next year. ®
