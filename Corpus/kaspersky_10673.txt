10 tips to protect your files from ransomware
Ransomware has become one of the most notorious cyberthreats. Once a ransomware Trojan infiltrates your system, it stealthily encrypts your files, including your valuable documents, videos and photos. This entire process runs in the background so the victim is not aware of the problem until it’s too late.
When done with its dirty business, the Trojan informs the user that their files are encrypted. If the victim wants to retrieve their files, they will have to pay a ransom, which is usually several hundreds of dollars, typically paid in bitcoins.
