Bypass Windows Login Password using Android Phone with DriveDroid

Drive Droid is an Android application that allows you to boot your PC from ISO/IMG files stored on your phone. This is ideal for trying Linux distributions or always having a rescue-system on the go… without the need to burn different CDs or USB pen drives.
Drive Droid also includes a convenient download menu where you can download USB-images of a number of operating systems from your phone. You can also create USB-images which allow you to have a blank USB-drive where you can store files in. Blank images also allow you to use tools on your PC to burn images to the drive and create a bootable USB disk that way.
You can manually download it from google playstore.
Note: need root privilegde means you need rooted phone.
