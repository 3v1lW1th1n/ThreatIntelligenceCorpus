Author: Robert McDaniel

 
This week saw more than a 30% increase in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. The biggest increases in phishing activity were in Computer Software (>180%), followed by Internet Content Providers (>165%), and Banking (>65%). While overall phishing activity increased, we saw a decrease in phishing activity for three industries. Internet Software & Services fell off the list with the largest decrease (>30%), followed by Storage & Systems Management Software (>7%), and eCommerce (>4%)

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
