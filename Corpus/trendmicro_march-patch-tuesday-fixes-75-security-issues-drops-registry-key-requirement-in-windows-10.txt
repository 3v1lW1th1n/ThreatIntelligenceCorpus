March Patch Tuesday Fixes 75 Security Issues, Drops Registry Key Requirement in Windows 10
Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday for March is an eventful one, with updates that comprise fixes for 75 security issues and a change of tack in its patch deployment process for Windows 10. Of the vulnerabilities Microsoft patched for this month, 14 were rated as Critical and 61 Important. Six of these were disclosed through Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative: CVE-2018-0815, CVE-2018-0816, CVE-2018-0878, CVE-2018-0889, CVE-2018-0929, and CVE-2018-0977.
Microsoft also lifted the requirement of an antivirus (AV) registry key in order to receive patches, at least on devices running Windows 10. The requirement was a way to mitigate compatibility issues with the patches they released for Meltdown and Spectre last January. Microsoft explained that their data indicated that incompatibilities were rare enough that it’s now a non-issue in Windows 10.
This month’s Patch Tuesday addresses security flaws in ASP.NET Core, ChakraCore, Edge, Internet Explorer, .NET Core, PowerShell Core, Windows operating system (OS), and Microsoft Office, Exchange Server, and Office Services and Web Apps. Most of the vulnerabilities were related to elevation of privileges, information disclosure, and memory corruption. Of note are:
Microsoft also released an advisory (ADV180006) addressing vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash in Internet Explorer. Adobe also issued its own security bulletin (APSB18-05), which fixes RCE vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash: CVE-2018-4919 and CVE-2018-4920. Adobe also released security updates for Adobe Connect (APSB18-06) and Dreamweaver (APSB18-07).
