Weekly Phishing Activity: September 25, 2017
This week, we saw an overall increase of >70% in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we monitor. Of note, four industries saw extreme increases in phishing activity. They included: Computer Hardware (>405%), Storage and System Management Software (>245%), Social Networks (>200%), and Internet Search & Navigation Services (>125%).
Only two industries saw decreases in phishing activity: Telecommunications at >40% and eCommerce at >25%.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
