Welcome to a New Look for ThreatpostToday we’re excited to unveil a better Threatpost. The update brings a fresh new look to the site, but also gives us a better platform overall, built and designed from the ground up for the future.Our first goal was to preserve all the things that didn’t need fixing – starting with Threatpost’s core mission and tradition of being a FUD-free voice of the InfoSec community. Our goal remains to be a trusted source for breaking news and analysis within the threat landscape, helping readers wade through the fire hose of security news headlines that are published daily.All of our flagship sections remain, as does our focus on vulnerabilities, attacks, malware, privacy and the policies that shape the industry. And we’ll continue to provide original reporting on the news. But we’ve added even more content, aimed at giving needed context and depth to the most important trends within the InfoSec landscape.First and foremost, we are proud to emphasize even more in-depth reports on timely security topics, with regular feature articles from our editorial staff.Also, in the weeks ahead, you’ll notice the addition of more trustworthy voices from the cybersecurity community, whom we’ve invited to share their expertise.We’re also adding more ways for readers to engage with Threatpost with the introduction of more podcasts, exclusive newsmaker interviews and fresh takes on the latest cybersecurity research.As we kick off the next generation of Threatpost, our mission is to serve you, the reader, with unique and even more comprehensive insight into the InfoSec landscape — whether you are a consumer, IT professional, security professional or an enterprise executive.Threatpost has been serving the InfoSec community for nearly 10 years — and armed with our new site, we look forward to serving it for the next 10 and beyond.Let us know what you think in the comments below.Tom SpringEditor-in-Chief
