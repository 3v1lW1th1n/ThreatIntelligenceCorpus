Hold on to your wallets — it’s tax (scam) season again
Tax season makes fools of many of us. Between confusion over complex filing rules and a general desire to claim the greatest possible refund, tax season is a cybercriminal’s paradise.
On the business side, accountants and payroll departments slammed with extra seasonal work are targeted for W2 scams. Ordinary people are more likely to encounter scams based on the promise of a tantalizing refund or a Nigerian-style twist involving magical refunds to be sent to a “collection agency.”
Of course, tax-themed phishing and malware are just seasonal icing on the year-round scam-cake that is modern, online living. Take the usual precautions — and perhaps be even a bit more wary than usual — to stay safe this tax season.
