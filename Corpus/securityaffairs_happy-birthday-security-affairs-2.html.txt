I’m very happy and proud to be here with you for the third year of SecurityAffairs. We are a growing community that has tens of new readers every day. I want to thank you for the support and the interest in a so complex subject, three years ago I started for joke saying that “Security is everyone’s responsibility”, this is our spirit. We have to spread awareness on cyber security, our goal is the mission of every government, only spreading and sharing the information on a cyber threat is possible to mitigate it.
Thank you, I want you with me in a place to celebrate all together … maybe one day we can do that.
I wish all the best for you and your families
Sincerely
Pierluigi
