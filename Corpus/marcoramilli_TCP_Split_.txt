TCP Split Handshake


As you've probably heard during these past few days a lot of discussions about the TCP Split Handshake have been made across the security community. I am not writing an opinion post on the topic, since a simple Google search keeps out tons of good articles on that. I am about to suggest the most significative reading on the TCP Split Handshake, already known from scientific community as TCP simultaneous connection. This interesting and well done  article is made by the "Macrothink Institute" in 2010. It is available freely here...  Have a nice reading !
