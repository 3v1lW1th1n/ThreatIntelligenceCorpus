					US National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers to Retire					
After a four-year term, the National Security Agency chief Admiral Mike Rogers plans to retire within months.
The Admiral Mike Rogers was chosen by President Barack Obama in 2014 when he replaced Gen. Keith Alexander. He was nominated for his significant experience in the cybersecurity field, he was involved in cyber defense and offense policy issues as head of the Fleet Cyber Command.

 
The news was confirmed by US intelligence sources, the Admiral Mike Rogers who also led the US Cyber Command sent a letter to its staff on Friday informing them that he would depart next spring.
The Rogers’s successor will be nominated by President Donald Trump this month.
Rogers is in opposition to Trump, The Observer reported recently that he has admitted in a private town-hall-style meeting of NSA staffing that Donald Trump did, in fact, collude with the Russians.
Rogers along with other US security chiefs presented a report to Trump on January 6, 2017 saying that Russians had interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
Unfortunately, during his management of the management the agency faced the clamorous and disconcerting leak of its exploits and hacking tools from its arsenal.
