Microsoft pulls another dodgy patch
Another Patch Update Tuesday, another red face for Microsoft, which has again been forced to pull a patch to prevent nasty side-effects.
Explained at TechNet, the patch that aimed to add “SHA-2 Hashing” to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 has instead raised some concerns among Redmond's customers.
The company is therefore “investigating behavior associated with this update” and recommends those who have installed the patch and have found things have gone awry should uninstall the software.
Redmond's reputation for reliable repairs is taking a battering at present, as recalls were required for patches issued in September and August.
Microsoft recently renamed its monthly delivery of patches to “Update Tuesday”, a rather more upbeat name than the traditional “Patch Tuesday”. Perhaps Redmond now needs to rename it “Temporary Update Tuesday”? ®
