iBanking mobile bot is a relative new-comer to the mobile malware scene, and has been available for sale in the underground for $5,000 since late last year. We first saw it spread through HTML injection attacks on banking sites, social engineering victims into downloading a so-called “security app” for their Android devices.” explained  in the blog post the Head of knowledge delivery and business development for RSA’s FraudAction Group, Daniel Cohen. 

It’s clear that the availability of iBanking mobile bot source code will give the opportunity for cybercriminals to build customized versions of the malware in the future.

The bot could be commanded via SMS or over HTTP beaconing C&C server every pre-defined interval, then pull and execute the command if one is awaiting it. The app implements the following features:
“The malware’s ability to capture SMS messages and audio recordings, as well as divert voice calls makes step-up authentication all the more challenging as fraudsters gain more control over the OOB device. This highlights the need for stronger authentication solutions capable of validating users’ identities using multiple factors including biometric solutions.”
