					You can take Shadow Brokers Zero Day Exploit Subscriptions for $21,000 per month					
A couple of weeks ago, while security experts were debating about WannaCry ransomware and the NSA exploits it used, the Shadow Brokers group revealed its plan to sell off new exploits every month starting from June. Shadow Brokers plans to offer a data dump based on a monthly subscription model.
The group claimed to have exploit codes for almost any technology available on the market, including “compromised network data from more SWIFT providers and Central banks.”
TheShadowBrokers Monthly Data Dump could be being:
Now as announced, the group will release new zero-days exploits and hacking tools for various platforms starting from June 2017.
The hacker crew is back with more information on how to subscribe to the monthly subscription service to receive access to the future leaks.
Shadows Brokers group has just released the following instruction to subscribe the service it called “Wine of Month Club.”
Welcome to TheShadowBrokers Monthly Dump Service – June 2017
Q: How do I subscribe and get the next theshadowbrokers’ dump (June 2017)?
#1 – Between 06/01/2017 and 06/30/2017 send 100 ZEC (Zcash) to this z_address:

#2 – Include a “delivery email address” in the “encrypted memo field” when sending Zcash payment
#3 – If #1 and #2 then a confirmation email will be sent to the “delivery email address” provided
#4 – Between 07/01/2017 and 07/17/2017 a “mass email” will be send to the “delivery email address” of all “confirmed subscribers” (#1, #2, #3)
#5 – The “mass email” will contain a link and a password for the June 2017 dump

Summarizing, experts who are interested in being members of the “wine of month club” would require to Send 100 ZEC (Zcash) (21,519 USD) and include a ‘delivery email address’ in the ‘encrypted memo field’.
Once received the payment, the Shadow Brokers will send a payment confirmation email to “delivery email address” provided by the subscriber.
The amount of money requested by hackers is very low, 21,000 USD for so precious information is a good affair for intelligence agencies and criminal syndicates.
Between 07/01/2017 and 07/17/2017 the group plans to send a link and a personal password to the subscribers for the June 2017 data dump.
Shadow Brokers still hasn’t decided the content of the June 2017 data dump, in its post, the notorious crew also expressed doubt about the total anonymity implemented by the Zcash cryptocurrency and the Tor network.
“Zcash is having connections to USG (DARPA, DOD, John Hopkins) and Israel. Why USG is “sponsoring” privacy version of bitcoin? Who the fuck is knowing? In defense, TOR is originally being by similar parties. TheShadowBrokers not fully trusting TOR either,” the Shadow Brokers writes.
Experts believe that the group will release authentic and legitimate exploits and hacking tools due to their past data leak.
The data dump could have a dramatic impact on organizations and business worldwide.
Stay tuned…
