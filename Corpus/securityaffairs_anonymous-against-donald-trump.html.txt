Anonymous is joining in the protest, declaring war against the presidential candidate, this week the collective published a video message announced its operation against the campaign of the US billionaire.
“Donald Trump, it has come to our attention that you want to ban all Muslims to enter the United States. This policy is going to have a huge impact. This is what ISIS wants. The more Muslims feel sad, the more ISIS feels that they can recruit them. Donald Trump, think twice before you speak anything. You have been warned, Donald Trump.” states the Video Message.
The group officially launched the #OpTrump hacking campaign against Donald Trump, on Wednesday night a DDoS attack hit the website for New York City’s Trump Towers, the website remained offline for hours.
Anonymous hasn’t claimed the attack, but several Twitter users confirmed their support to the #OpTrump campaign.
The American Billionaire was already targeted by Anonymous in the past, a few months ago the collective defaced the website Trump.com with a tribute to Jon Stewart.
“Mr Stewart, we at @TelecomixCanada would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the many happy years of quality journalism and entertainment you and your team have undertaken at Comedy Central,” reads a letter on Trump’s site.
