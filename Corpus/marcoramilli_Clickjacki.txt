ClickJacking ?


I really don't like the numerous names that people like to invent.Is this "ClickJacking" ?function me() {var w = window.open("http://www.google.com"); setTimeout(function () {w.location ="http://marcoramilli.blogspot.com";}, 2000);}Well, in my opinion it's a simple code injection. I think more name you give at the same concept more confusion you make over the concept.
