Tumblr blames human error for 'minor' security breach
Blogging platform tumblr has downplayed the significance of a security breach over the weekend.
Tumblr admitted human error led to the exposure of "sensitive server configuration information", but not the rumoured disclosure of users' login details. Tumblr, which fixed the problem a few hours after its discovery, is reviewing its procedures to make sure similar mishaps are avoided in future.
"We’re triple checking everything and bringing in outside auditors to confirm, but we have no reason to believe that anything was compromised," a status update on an official tumblr page explains.
"We’re certain that none of your personal information (passwords, etc.) was exposed, and your blog is backed up and safe as always."
Tumblr is a microblogging platform designed to make it easy for users to post images, videos and general musing on life onto a short-form blog. The service boasts 15 million users.
