It's 2015 and VMware tools break VMs if you open two browser tabs
VMware has revealed a couple of nasty bugs in its vRealize Automation products.
One causes hard disks to disappear. Detailed here, the flaw impacts vRealize Automation 6.x and means “hard disks are removed unexpectedly when reconfiguring a virtual machine that has RDM disks.” That's obviously a bad idea seeing as hard disks store data that a VM probably needs!
There's no fix for the problem at the time of writing, but VMware's working on one.
Another glitch, also in vRealize Automation, means that “when performing a reconfigureVM workflow on a virtual machine to reduce the number of CPUs, the hard disks and NICs are also removed.” This one's a real face-palmer, because it happens when you have vRealize Automation in more than one browser tab or window.
“To avoid this issue,” VMware advises, “do not connect to VMware vRealize Automation with more than one browser tab or browser window.” ®
