SNAFU: Blighty's judges not trustworthy, says their own website
UK.gov's judiciary website has had its security compromised after bungling administrators failed to renew a security certificate.
The judiciary.gov.uk site is designed to provide information on Blighty's top legal bods and information on judgments. It represents the Judicial Office, which reports to the Lord Chief Justice and Senior President of Tribunal.
On trying to access the site this morning, The Register's browsers threw up an embarrassing error message: "www.judiciary.gov.uk uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate expired on 27/05/2015 00:59."
This means that judiciary.gov.uk lacks a verifiably secure HTTPS connection – in other words, the communications browser and website are no longer encrypted.
A spokesman from the Judicial Office told El Reg that people wanting to access its site should do so by clicking past the security warning.
Firefox's default settings trigger a further warning if you do this: "Even if you trust the site, this error could mean that someone is tampering with your connection."
The Register has requested further comment and will provide an update to this story if we do hear more. ®
