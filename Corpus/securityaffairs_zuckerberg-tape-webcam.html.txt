					Ops … also Zuckerberg covers the webcam with tapes					
A Facebook post published by Mark Zuckerberg to celebrate more than 500 million people now use Instagram is attracting the attention of IT experts.
In the image that is included in the post, Zuckerberg’s laptop is visible in the background. Watchful eyes can see that the webcam of the laptop and the audio jack of the appear to be covered by tape.

Evidently, the king of the social networks fears that someone could hack his laptop, and I can tell you that the prudence is never enough.
Zuckerberg isn’t the first VIP to adopt this measure, back in April, the FBI’s director, James Comey admitted the use of tapes over his webcam to protect himself from prying eyes.
During the Q&A session at Kenyon College, the FBI Director explained that he uses tape to mitigate the danger of cyber espionage. It’s clear that the FBI Director Comey fears possible hacking campaign operated by nation-state hackers, Russia and China are most dreaded adversary in this sense.
“I saw something in the news, so I copied it.” he explained. “I put a piece of tape — I have obviously a laptop, personal laptop — I put a piece of tape over the camera. Because I saw somebody smarter than I am had a piece of tape over their camera.”
It is the beginning of a trend? For sure many others will follow the example of Comey and Zuckerberg.
After all, it costs nothing, and it’s cool;-)
