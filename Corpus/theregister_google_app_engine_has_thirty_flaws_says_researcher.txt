Google App Engine has THIRTY flaws, says researcher
Adam Gowdiak of Polish security consultancy and research outfit Security Explorations claims to have found myriad security holes in Google's App Engine.
Explained here, Gowdiak says he and his colleagues “discovered multiple security issues in Google App Engine that allow for a complete Java VM security sandbox escape.”
Here's how Gowdiak says this went down:
Gowdiak says “There are more issues pending verification - we estimate them to be in the range of 30+ in total.”
Gowdiaks' efforts to learn more are stalled for now because Google has shut down his account. There's no sign Google did so maliciously or to crimp the firm's efforts: Gowdiak says his research probably looked like an attack to Google.
"Taking into account an educational nature of the security issues found in Google Apps Engine Java security sandbox and what seems to be an appreciation Google has for arbitrary security research [and] all sorts of sandbox escapes, we hope the company makes it possible for us to complete our work," he says. ®
