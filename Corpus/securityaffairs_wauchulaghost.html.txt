					WauchulaGhost targets ISIS Twitter Accounts and floods them with porn images					
Anonymous is continuing its online battle against the ISIS propaganda machine, this time, Twitter accounts managed by the terrorist organization have been flooded with a large number of pornographic posts.

It seems that the attacks have been coordinated by Anonymous members to take over Twitter accounts of ISIS members and supporters.
The hackers replaced the profile pictures of the hacked IS Twitter accounts with porn pictures displaying text like ‘I Love Porn.’
The vast majority of Twitter accounts targeted by the hackers are from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria.
Below the message left by the WauchulaGhost crew that is one of the hacker group more active against the IS online:

WauchulaGhost is hunting ISIS supporters online, it was able to target hundreds of accounts within a few minutes.
The anti-ISIS groups are running a botnet that is able to generate porn images flood the IS accounts. Technically we call them Pornbots, a plethora of fake accounts featuring an adult theme, which are instructed with automated scripts to follow ISIS militants and flood them with unwanted porn. In some cases the hackers took over ISIS account and use them as active components of their Pornbots.
In this last campaign, WauchulaGhost has created a Twitter list that includes all the hacked profiles. At the time of writing, the Jacked Account list includes 161 accounts.
Among the victims of the WauchulaGhost there is also a French ISIS account that is very active in propaganda activity.
The use of Porn in not new in anti-ISIS campaigns, other groups of hackers have used to deface ISIS content with pornographic images as a derogatory sign.
