North Carolina has amended its Money Transmitters Act, to introduce a new Bitlicense. The new legislation  applies to custodian exchanges and wallet providers offering non-fiat virtual, digital and crypto-currency services to consumers. To get a Bitlicense, a business musts ubmit an application to the Commissioner; pay a non-refundable filing fee of at least $1,500; have, and maintain, a net worth of at least $250,000; post and maintain a surety bond with the Commissioner for at least $150,000 – although (a) this amount will be increased if the money transmission volumes in North Carolina are greater than $1,000,000 a year; and (b) the bond can be replaced by cash, or near-cash financial instruments, if that’s what the applicant would prefer. The Commissioner also has the discretion to require the applicant to obtain (additional) insurance for cybersecurity risks, if they’re not within the scope of the surety bond (or there isn’t one).

“The European Union is taking steps that could lead to a third antitrust complaint against Google, this time over its lucrative advertising services, according to three people familiar with the EU investigation.
EU officials sent the search giant’s critics requests to allow their evidence to be shared with Google, said the people, who asked not to be named because the case is private. One request was sent as recently as last week, one person said. Such a move is typically a precursor to a formal EU statement of objections cataloging how a firm may have violated EU antitrust law.“
