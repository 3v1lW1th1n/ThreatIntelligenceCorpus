Palo Alto Networks splashes $US200 million on Cyvera
Palo Alto Networks has announced that it's buying Tel Aviv-based Cyvera for $US200 million, including $US88 million in cash.
The attraction is the Israeli company's TRAPS (Targeted Remote Attack Prevention System), an endpoint protection system for Windows machines, which PAN will add to its existing firewall and cloud security products.
PAN's blog post about the acquisition makes the bold claim that Cyvera has “successfully stopped every published zero-day attack since they first began deploying their product”.
Announcing the acquisition, PAN's CEO Mark McLaughlin tagged endpoint security as a market worth between $US4 billion and $US5 billion.
Details on the operation of Cyvera's technology are sketchy, but according to the San Jose Mercury News, it impressed PAN's co-founder Nir Zuk, who said the normal zero-day attack toolkit is “limited to about 20 different techniques … what Cyvera does is basically blocks the bad guys from being able to use those techniques.”
Cyvera's 55 staff will remain in Israel, and the acquisition is expected to be completed in the second half of the year. ®
