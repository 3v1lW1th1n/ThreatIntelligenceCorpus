Just kidding


I know, this post is quite out of topic, but yesterday I saw a funny police man over an hold and slow Harley,  and immediately comes in my mind Italian's police, the fastest police in the world (fastest in terms of cars and motors). I cannot stop me to show this picture :DI'm just kidding, I know that US' police is very different !
