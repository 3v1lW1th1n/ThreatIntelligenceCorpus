Morphisec is honored to have received awards in three out of six categories at this year's Midmarket CIO Spring Forum. The annual Vendor Excellence and Midmarket CIO Awards recognize leaders in technology collaboration. 
Over 77% of all cyber crimes target small and midsize enterprises. According to the 2017 State of Cybersecurity in Small & Medium-Sized Businesses (SMB) report by the Ponemon Institute, cyberattacks cost small and medium-sized businesses an average of $2,235,000.
Like larger enterprises, midmarket companies face a growing threat from advanced attacks that evade standard defenses. Yet many advanced threat protection solutions demand labor intensive management, monitoring, and response that take time and resources away from critical revenue and growth initiatives. Morphisec’s Moving Target Defense prevents advanced attacks before they can even get a foothold – no wading through alerts, investigating or remediation needed.
In addition to two vendor category awards, Morphisec was recognized for their partnership with RC Woodson, VP of IT at Doyon, Limited in his achieving the Midmarket CIO Award of Excellence. ”Morphisec empowered our company’s security team with real-time insight including, never before available, critical attack behavior details of every advanced threat blocked,” said Woodson.
