I was within the official source to spot the 23-year-old teenager who developed the BlackPOS malware thanks to the revelations made by Cyber Intelligence firm IntelCrawler.
The author of BlackPOS was known as “ree[4]” in the underground market, researchers at IntelCrawler in a first analysis identified SergeyTarasov, but after further investigation they found the right person, a 23-year-old young hacker named Rinat Shabayev that has probably collaborated with Sergey Taraspov, who  provided him technical support for the designing of the malicious code.
In the previous reports of Cyber Intelligence firm ‘IntelCrawler‘ named SergeyTarasov, a 17-year-old teenager behind the nickname “ree [4]”, as the development of Black POS malware, according the investigation the malicious code was used to infect systems at Target and probably also at Neiman Marcus, two of the biggest US retailers.
The figured related to the Target data breach are disturbing, Credit-Debit cards and personal information belonging to nearly 110 million consumers are at risk.
It seems that Rinat Shabayev, aka ree[4], and the teen,Sergey Taraspov have collaborated to design the BlackPOS Malware, but they aren’t responsible for the data theft at the Target retailer, according the investigation they developed the malicious agent to sell it to other criminal gangs based in Eastern Europe.
