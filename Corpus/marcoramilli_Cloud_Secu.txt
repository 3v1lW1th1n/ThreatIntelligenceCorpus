Cloud Security: Infographics





In the last 2 years I've been working mostly on private companies. Since often the "computer security" is not on the company main business ( ... in fact, for many companies computer security is just a kind of "utility"... ) because belonging to a different, often even not digitalized, world, having a survey of what they think about "security" is always a welcomed help. The following infographic, made by PersecSys is a nice, coincise and good looking survey of what 130 security professionals from RSA conference think about Cloud Security in the companies they serve.
