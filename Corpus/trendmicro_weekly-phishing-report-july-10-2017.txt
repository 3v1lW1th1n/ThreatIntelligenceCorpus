This week, we saw aÂ (5%) decrease in phishing activity. From the top 20 brands we monitor, five industries saw phishing increases, and six saw decreases. The three industries that saw increases were: Social Networks (>40%), Computer Software (>30%), and Banking (>10%). The top three industries that saw decreases were: Storage and Systems Management Software (>45%), Hospitality (>40%), and Telecommunications (>30%).
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
