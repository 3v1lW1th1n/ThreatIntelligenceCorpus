					CVE-2018-0229 flaw in SAML implementation threatens Firepower, AnyConnect and ASA products					
The CVE-2018-0229 flaw could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software.
“A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Desktop Platforms, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software.” reads the security advisory published by CISCO.
 “The authentication would need to be done by an unsuspecting third party.”
The CVE-2018-0229 flaw affects the following Cisco solutions:
According to Cisco, the flaw exists because there the ASA or FTD Software doesn’t implement any mechanism to detect that the authentication request originates from the AnyConnect client directly.
An attacker could exploit the CVE-2018-0229 vulnerability by tricking victims into clicking a specifically crafted link and authenticating using the company’s Identity Provider (IdP). In this scenario, the attacker can hijack a valid authentication token and use that to establish and set up an AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software.

The flaw affects the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, and ASA Software and FTD Software configured for SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect Remote Access VPN that is running on the following Cisco products:
Cisco confirmed that only ASA software running version 9.7.1 and later are vulnerable, the issue also affects FTD software running version 6.2.1 and later, and AnyConnect version 4.4.00243 and later.
