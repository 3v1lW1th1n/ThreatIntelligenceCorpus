FBI seizes Mixmaster servers
Non-profit Riseup claims the FBI has seized a Mixmaster server from a colo shared by Riseup Networks in New York City.
The organization has issued a media release linking the siezure to investigations into Mixmaster as part of its investigation into ongoing bomb threats against the University of Pittsburgh.
The university has received more than 90 bomb threats since February.
According to Riseup, another user of the facility, May First/People Link, says the server was removed under an FBI search warrant. As well as a Mixmaster remailer, Riseup claims the server, operated by the European Counter Network, hosted an Italian cyber rights mailing list and a Mexican migrant solidarity group.
“Over 300 e-mail accounts, between 50-80 email lists, and several other Websites have been taken off the Internet by this action,” Riseup says. “None are alleged to be involved in the anonymous bomb threats.”
Riseup also criticizes the action on the basis that the Mixmaster server is unlikely to yield any useful information, because the anonymous remailer “does not record logs of connections, details of who sent messages, or how they were routed”. ®
