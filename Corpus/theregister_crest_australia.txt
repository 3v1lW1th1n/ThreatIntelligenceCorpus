Oz pen testers to get CREST creds
The Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) has opened a local chapter, with help from Australia's Federal Government.
CREST certifies ethical hackers, giving them a shinier CV. Outfits who hire certified staff gain confidence that they're shelling out for someone with both integrity and solid skills.
A press release emitted by Federal Attorney General Nicola Roxon says CERT Australia will work hand in hand with CREST and will send folks to “various CREST sub-committees alongside business members.” She also says having a local CREST is a fine idea as it will mean local businesses can hire white hackers without all the “trust me, I would never hack you or sell your secrets to a rival” nervousness associated with hiring white hats.
Alastair MacGibbon, currently Director of the Centre of Internet Safety at the University of Canberra and the former Director of the AFP Australian High Tech Crime Centre, will be the founding Chief Executive Officer of CREST Australia.
Australia's CREST is affiliated with CREST Great Britain.
