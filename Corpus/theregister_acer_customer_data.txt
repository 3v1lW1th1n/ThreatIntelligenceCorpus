Hackers say Acer breach leaked data for 40,000 users
Hackers say they breached the website security of computer-maker Acer and made off with data for 40,000 of its customers.
Screenshots posted on Friday on The Hacker News appeared to show the purchase histories, names, email addresses, and partial addresses and phone numbers for a limited number of customers stored on acer-euro.com. The site said members of the Pakistan Cyber Army were behind the attack and planned to release the data in the next 24 hours.
“We got mail from PCA that they successfully hacked the FTP of ACER and Stole around 40,000 Users Data, Various Source Codes stored on server,” The Hacker News said.
The report comes as dozens of companies and government agencies, including RSA, the Fox network, and the State of Massachusetts, have suffered security breaches that have leaked sensitive consumer information or proprietary company data. At the top of the list is Sony, which over the past six weeks has been the target of a series of devastating hacks that have exposed details for than 100 million customers, including one that surfaced on Thursday.
In some of the cases, the breaches were the result of targeted phishing campaigns, while in others hackers gained entry by exploiting easy-to-spot vulnerabilities in the companies' website applications.
A screenshot posted on The Hacker News showed an FTP application that appeared to have a valid username and password for ftp.acer-euro.com, but it wasn't clear how the credentials had been obtained.
The report said the hackers also stole source code used on Acer's website.
Acer representatives didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment for this post. ®
