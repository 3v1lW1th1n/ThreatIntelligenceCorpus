McDonald’s Canada confirmed that hackers have stolen the personal data of about 95,000 job seekers from its recruitment website.
The data were provided by candidates searching for a job at McDonald’s Canada since March 2014. The company has launched an investigation into the data breach that exposed job candidates’ names, addresses, emails, telephone numbers, employment histories and other personal data.
“The McDonald’s Canada (“McDonald’s”) career website (http://www.mcdonalds.ca/ca/en/careers.html or http://www.mcdonalds.ca/ca/fr/careers.html) was recently subject to a cyber-attack.” reads the data breach notification published by the company.
“As a result, the personal information of approximately 95,000 restaurant job applicants has been compromised. Applicants affected are those who applied online for a job at a McDonald’s Canada restaurant between March 2014 and March 2017. “

McDonald’s Canada has shut down the recruitment website, fortunately the company doesn’t request sensitive data such as health information, social insurance numbers and financial information.
The company confirmed that it is not aware of any abuse of the stolen data.
“The careers webpage will remain shut down until the investigation is complete and appropriate measures are taken to ensure that this type of security breach does not happen again,” continues the breach notification.
