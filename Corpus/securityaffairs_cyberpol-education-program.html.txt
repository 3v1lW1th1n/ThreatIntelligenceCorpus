CYBERPOL announced today that it  has refined CYBERPOL’s  focus arena and will be focusing on three main areas of cyber analytical research namely, Cyber Crime, Cyber threats and Cyber Intelligence CYBINT.
The collective goal is to understand Cyber Crime and Cyber Terrorism trends using databases to weaken cyber attacks and cyber crime syndicates. This will allow for collective global educational training programs in cyber risk management and cyber threat prevention area.
The CYBERPOL training programs that is under present under present construction, is aimed to educate both law-enforcement and cyber security officers (CSO) who is responsible for any cyber networks or management of cyber environments.

It said that traditional law enforcement days is over and that Cyber Police has lost its way long time ago and the cyber technological developments reached a point in time and history where criminals is so well equipped with cyber tools, that the lack of understating and training on cyber law-enforcement  far exceeds the ability to fight the cybercrime today.
Training is the route and education is the key solution to fighting any global cyber crime problems, CYBERPOL  said.  CYBERPOL provides an interface with each focus area between research and policy-making so that our research conclusions can be translated into actionable policies.
