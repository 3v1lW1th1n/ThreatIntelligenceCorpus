Summertime and DOMScan


Hi folks,it is summertime, which means beaches, ocean, BBQ and friends. It has been long time since I had an Italian summertime, so apologize myself if you do not see much new stuff on my personal blog :).Ok, now lets talk about DOMScan a great project for web pen testers:DOMScan is utility to drive IE and capture real time DOM from the browser. It gives access to active DOM context along with JavaScripts. One can observe the DOM in detail using this utility. It has predefined rules to scan DOM. One can run the scan on existing DOM and fetch interesting entry points and calls. It allows tracing through JavaScript variables as well.DOMScan is a multipurose tool can be used for many types of testing like web application , penetration testing , code deguging or some what fuzzing. It up to us how to use it.
