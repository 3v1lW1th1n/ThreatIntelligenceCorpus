Mobile computing is great. No longer are we chained to our desks when using technology and doing proper work. Not only are laptops getting smaller, lighter and cheaper, it is also possible to do real, productive stuff even more freely using phones and tablets.

IT governance has many definitions. In my day job, governance is all about ensuring that the manner in which we connect and use our IT systems is auditable, trackable and accountable, primarily in the context of security and confidentiality.
We will look at governance in the specific context of mobile devices: they are, after all, far harder to control and manage than the kit that sits on your office desks.
