Fortinet axes two per cent of workforce, chops 100 sales, ad staff, execs
Fortinet has laid off 100 sales and marketing staff along with an unknown number of executives, as part of a company wide restructure that has axed about two percent of its workforce
The job losses flow from the company's acquisition of IT operations analytics outfit AccelOps in June 2016.
Fortinet told The Register in a statement the job cuts will help company growth.
"To position Fortinet for success now and in the future, we continue to take necessary steps to ensure that our resources and investments are aligned and that we have the right talent in the right places to drive our strategy and growth," a spokeswoman said.
The company's chief marketing officer Holly Rollo left in March for RSA and has not yet been replaced. ®
