McAfee issued a new report estimating the global cost of cybercrime, a lucrative industry that despite partial data could be costing the world economy as much as $575 billion annually.
The Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime report has been prepared using multiple sources, from government to academic organizations trying to evaluate the direct and indirect cost.
 “Cybercrime is a growth industry. The returns are great, and the risks are low. We estimate that the likely annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime is more than $400 billion.1 A conservative estimate would be $375 billion in losses, while the maximum could be as much as $575 billion.”
