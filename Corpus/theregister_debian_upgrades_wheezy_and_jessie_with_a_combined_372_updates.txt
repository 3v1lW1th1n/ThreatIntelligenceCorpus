Debian upgrades Wheezy and Jessie with a combined 372 updates
Popular GNU/Linux distribution Debian published the second update to its “Jessie” stable release over the weekend and the ninth update for its older “Wheezy” edition.
Debian Jessie 8.2 “mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems”, according to the distro's announcement of its new release. The Reg has counted 60 security fixes and 68 updated packages in the new release.
By our count Wheezy 7.9, also revealed over the weekend, updates 60 packages and offers 184 security fixes.
Plenty of the bugs have already been blasted, so Debian advises that “Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are included in this update.” And of course Debian is Linux so even if you have been tardy, upgrading to the new releases doesn't need much more than a quick bit of sudo action to get things humming.
The Wheezy release is arguably more serious because Debian's releases policy states that “When a new stable version is released, the security team will usually cover the previous version for a year or so.” The last Wheezy update came out in January 2015, a rather slower release cadence than Jessie which has had two updates since its late April 2015 release. The big new Wheezy update therefore represents one of the few remaining occasions on which Debian's volunteer devs will give the distro their full attention. ®
