EMC gobbles access-control biz Aveksa? Computer says... yes
EMC has acquired privately held Aveksa, which touts identity and access management technology to modest-sized businesses.
Financial terms of the deal, announced on Monday, were undisclosed. Aveksa - headquartered in Massachusetts but runs an office in Blighty's capital - develops gear that allows companies to control access to particular applications: rights can be granted to groups or individuals without the need for a large corporate IT structure.
EMC's existing RSA Security division provides similar technology alongside its core login tokens and associated technology for remote access to corporate applications and emails.
RSA's offerings are much better known in the industry so what Aveksa adds to the party is a "unified dashboard to manage, control, and deliver access, while consistently enforcing identity and access policies across the enterprise and cloud", we're told.
A product shake-up of some sort seems likely even though EMC is keen to stress that technology from RSA and Aveksa will be complementary. "Aveksa and RSA together will align insight from roles, processes, and security-oriented big data to help enable better visibility, prioritization, detection and response to risk and real-time threats," the bit-bucket overlord said. ®
