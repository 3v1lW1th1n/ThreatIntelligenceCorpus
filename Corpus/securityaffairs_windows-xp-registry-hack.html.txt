On April 8th 2014 Microsoft officially ended the support for Windows XP, but there is still a wide audience of users that are using the oldest Microsoft OS.
This portion of users is no more receiving security updates with serious consequences on cyber security perspective. Some organizations are still facing economic and technical problems to migrate the operating system’s running Windows XP to another operating system. Anyway, Microsoft is still providing support to customers that are paying it, this is the case of critical applications for which the migration request more time and it is not possible to leave the systems vulnerable, let’s thing to critical infrastructure and government environments.
