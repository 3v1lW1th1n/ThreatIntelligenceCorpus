Sophos undertakes unified unified threat management unification
Sophos has launched a threat intelligence sharing platform 'XG' for its endpoint and network security firewalls and unified threat management systems.
It means kit within homogeneous Sophos houses will be able to share threat intelligence data such as an endpoint screaming to network security boxens whenever an employee runs malware.
Sophos kit did previously chatter, but not on the level of the new kit, in which threat communication is dubbed 'heartbeats'.
Existing customers can upgrade under a plan, while channel types can manage their client Sophos installs over the internet.
Sophos Asia Pacific managing director Stuart Fisher says the latter method is thought to be the most popular.
"We believe what is unique in the market is combining the endpoint security, threat detection and remediation together with the network security aspect," Fisher tells El Reg.
"It combines an interface between the endpoint and the network to provide better security and remediation."
Prices are available through Sophos partners and the platform is available today.
Businesses should first ensure they are compliant with Australian Signals Directorate's much-lauded Top 4 Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions which when followed will do more to improve organisational security than any technology. Top of the list is thorough best practise application whitelisting.
