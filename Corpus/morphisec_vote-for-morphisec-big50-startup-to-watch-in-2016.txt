Amidst the pageantry and spectacle of the US primaries, there’s a quieter vote going on, one that takes only a few seconds from you. We’re talking about Startup50 2016. Finalists make it into Jeff Vance’s Big50 Startup Report, which features “in-depth coverage of the 50 coolest tech startups founded in the last five years.” Morphisec has been nominated in the Cybersecurity and Storage category. We already made it through Round 1 (go Morphisec!) and Round 2 for this category is open for voting now.
