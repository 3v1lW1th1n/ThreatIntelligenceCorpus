There are a lot of interesting communities on the web, but Hackforums is still the best.

Yes, I have participated in several attacks, but not so much. I’m not the best on defacing websites I’m known for my DDoSing abilities, for developing DDoS scripts, proxies, doxxes and all the other things I sell. You can check my shop  You can find Isis Accounts on @tool_binary and @CtrlSec.
We often hear about cyber weapons and cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. Do you believe it is real the risk of a major and lethal cyber attack against a critical infrastructure?
Why not, security is just an illusion and a fucking shit. Thanks!
