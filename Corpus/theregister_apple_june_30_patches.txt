Apple ships security fixes for iOS, OS X, Safari ... basically EVERYTHING
Apple on Monday shipped new versions of its operating systems, its web browser, and Apple TV firmware – with each update a minor release aimed at fixing bugs and closing security vulnerabilities.
The latest release of OS X Mavericks, version 10.9.4, addresses a total of 19 vulnerabilities in a variety of OS subsystems, ranging from graphics and Thunderbolt drivers to the Dock.
It also claims to speed up waking from sleep, and to fix one issue where Macs wouldn't connect to known Wi-Fi networks, and another where the Apple logo didn't appear onscreen properly during boot-up.
The update also brings the Safari web browser to version 7.0.5, which is also available as a standalone update – as is an update to Safari 6.1.5.
Each of those update packs fixes a dozen vulnerabilities in the WebKit rendering engine, including multiple memory-corruption issues that could potentially allow a malicious website to crash the browser or execute arbitrary code. Many of these had already been fixed in the upstream WebKit source tree, but had yet to make their way into Safari.
The last Safari update, version 7.0.4, shipped a month ago and fixed 22 WebKit vulnerabilities.
Over on the shiny side of things, iOS 7.1.2 fixes a whole host of vulnerabilities, including a whopping 30 issues in the mobile version of WebKit. Mail, Safari, Siri, and the OS kernel also get the patch treatment, among other packages.
Finally, Cupertino has also been beavering away plugging holes in its Apple TV platform. Apple TV 6.2, which can run on the second-generation Apple TVs or later, includes fixes for 35 issues, many of them being the same WebKit bugs that are addressed by the Safari and iOS updates.
All of the aforementioned fixes are available via Apple's usual upgrade channels. ®
