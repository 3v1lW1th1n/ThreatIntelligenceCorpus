The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) has hit a new series of targets in a large hacking campaign against high profile Qatar based websites. The Syrian Electronic Army is considered one of the most active and dangerous group of hacktivists due the large number of high profile companies and government entities it has attacked with success, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, The Financial Times, The Guardian, the Associated Press, Aljazeera, numerous Government and Military websites and The White House.
Qatar is #down 
A so huge list is really shocking in my opinion and demonstrates how much dangerous could be state-sponsored operations against private enterprises that must be supported by respective government cyber strategies.
Why Syrian Electronic Army attacked Qatar?
The Syrian Electronic Army has targeted Qatar government many times due to the support it provides to the rebels inside Syria that desire to overthrow the President Al-Assad’s regime.
Last April the group hacked FIFA’s Twitter accounts to publicly accuse Qatar of buying the 2022 World Cup, the attack was anticipated by the hack of Qatar Foundation’s social media accounts.
Fortunately DNS attacks like these ones have a limited impact, typically victims are able to regain control of their websites a few hours after such offensive.
