Facebook sues 'Spamford' Wallace over spam scam
Facebook has launched a lawsuit against infamous junk mail merchant Sanford "Spamford" Wallace.
Wallace, along with co-defendants Las Vegas night club manager Adam Arzoomanian and Scott Shaw, face charges of violating the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. Mediapost adds the the suit covers allegations that Wallace and his business associates spammed Facebook members with wall posts that posed as messages from their friends. The gang allegedly hacked into accounts using phishing techniques before sending the offending messages.
Facebook's legal action comes three months after the social networking site was awarded $873m in a suit against Adam Guerbuez and his firm Atlantis Blue Capital for violations of US federal anti-spam laws. Guerbuez did not contest the action, which would otherwise have cleared up the undecided legal point on whether or not the CAN-SPAM Act applies to messages sent through social networking websites.
Wallace is no stranger to accusation of malicious marketing activities on social networking websites. Wallace and business partner Walter Rines were ordered to pay $230m to MySpace last May after a court held them responsible for using malware and social engineering to promote porn and gambling sites. That action was also uncontested by the defendants. ®
