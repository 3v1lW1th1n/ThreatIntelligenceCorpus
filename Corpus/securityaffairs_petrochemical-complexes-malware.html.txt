“Iran has detected and removed malicious software from two of its petrochemical complexes, a senior military official said on Saturday, after announcing last week it was investigating whether recent petrochemical fires were caused by cyber attacks.” reported by Venturebeat.com.
The official also added that the malware was not responsible for the incidents occurred at the petrochemical complexes, the experts discovered that it was inactive and not linked to the fires.
“In periodical inspection of petrochemical units, a type of industrial malware was detected and the necessary defensive measures were taken,” Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran’s civilian defense, said the state news agency IRNA.
“the discovery of this industrial virus is not related to recent fires.”
As declared by the oil minister, the string of fires in petrochemical complexes was caused by the lack of proper safety measures caused by the cut of the budgets operated by the firms in the energy sector.
