The EU digital chief Andrus Ansip announced his plan to set up a new office to certify the level of cyber security implemented in technology products.
The European Commission vice-president is thinking of a network of cybersecurity offices, so-called centers of excellence, spread across the states of the Union that will be focused on certifying the cyber security measures implemented by products.
“European products and cybersecurity products are not able, only some of them are able, to compete in the world market. We have to pay much more attention to this,” Ansip explained.

In September, Ansip will present new measures on cybersecurity certification, including a system to grade products based on their security features.
Ansip also added that in September there will be an updated EU cyber security strategy in order to improve the ability of European organizations to respond to attacks.

Ansip described the EU as a scenario where most countries don’t have resources to repel cyber attacks, for this reason, it is necessary to improve cooperation and the information sharing.
“Just in five EU member states we have 24/7 capabilities when we are talking about national CERTs,” Ansip said.
