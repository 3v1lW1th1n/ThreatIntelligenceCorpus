“We had to disable Agora for now since they have gone offline, but as soon as they are back their listings will start showing up in the search results again.” said GramsAdmin.
I have no doubt, search engines have an infinite power and I’m sure that the author of Grams will try to expand the capabilities of its platform including data from the other relevant black market. The author has also announced that the Grams will include advertising exactly like Google AdWords, reveling the business model behind the search engine.
“Within the next two weeks Grams will have a system similar to google adwords where vendors can buy keywords and their listings will go to the top of the search results when those keywords are searched for. They will be bordered with an advertisement disclaimer so users know those are paid results.”
Grams is probably a little light that is trying to make inroads into the depths of the black market.
