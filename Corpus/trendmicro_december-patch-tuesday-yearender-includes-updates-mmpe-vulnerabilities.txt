December Patch Tuesday: Yearender Includes Updates for MMPE Vulnerabilities
It was a relatively low-key year-ender for Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday, as the company’s monthly release of updates was relatively light in terms of noteworthy vulnerabilities. With that said, there were still a few notable vulnerabilities that were addressed. Perhaps the most significant of these were CVE-2017-11937 and CVE-2017-11940, two remote code execution vulnerabilities concerning the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MMPE), which can cause memory corruption due to MMPE’s inability to scan certain files properly. Attackers can use specially crafted files to exploit the vulnerability, resulting in a compromised system. The fix for these vulnerabilities is actually available in out-of-band updates that were later included in the general Patch Tuesday release.
Overall, Patch Tuesday addressed 12 Critical-rated vulnerabilities and 10 rated as Important, of which two were disclosed via Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative. In addition to the MMPE vulnerability updates, some of the other noteworthy fixes include:
