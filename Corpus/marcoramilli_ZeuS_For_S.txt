ZeuS For Sale ?


I've been working on Zeus Malware for a while ( lets see here , here and here ) but I've never known that its source code is now for sale ! Transcript of the post:+------------------------------------+Hey!Selling full source code of the latest Zeus Bot from author for cheap price. I do not sell bins.|SCREENSHOT FOR THE LULZ |PAYMENTLR / WMZ / WU (Any verified escrow service accepted)|CONTACT INFAICQ 60[removed]9345JABBER ioo[at]ja[removed].comPS. Awaiting for admin verification...+------------------------------------+This is, on one hand  good because researchers could take a closer look to what it does and how it has been so spread, on the other hand it could be the base for a enhanced Zeus, which of course is not a good news at all. In fact we wont forget Murofet: the Zeus's "ancestor" (or son ?).If  it's true is going to be a huge news but as the CSIS said, this is a very much "AS IS" news, no code have been technically verified, BUT if you guys know where to grab such a codes,  shut me comments please.
