“MIUI does not secretly upload photos and text messages. MIUI requests public data from Xiaomi servers from time to time. These include data such as preset greeting messages (thousands of jokes, holiday greetings and poems) in the Messaging app and MIUI OTA update notifications, i.e. all non-personal data that does not infringe on user privacy.” Barra said.
To the question: “Does Xiaomi upload any personal data without my knowledge?” he replied:
Xiaomi offers a service called Mi Cloud that enables users to back up and manage personal information in the cloud, as well as sync to other devices.  This includes contacts, notes, text messages and photos. Mi Cloud is turned off by default.  Users must log in with their Mi accounts and manually turn on Mi Cloud.  They also have the option to only turn on backup for certain types of data. The use and storage of data in Mi Cloud fully respects the local laws of each country and region.  Strict encryption algorithms are implemented to protect user privacy. 
The expert refers to the Xiaomi’s Mi Cloud Service as the service used by the company to backup personal information in the cloud. Hugo announced that from today users’ will be able to turn OFF Mi Cloud Service manually from the mobile device.
“We have scheduled an OTA system update for today (Aug 10th) to implement this change. After the upgrade, new users or users who factory reset their devices can enable the service by visiting “Settings > Mi Cloud > Cloud Messaging” from their home screen or “Settings > Cloud Messaging” inside the Messaging app — these are also the places where users can turn off Cloud Messaging.” he added.
