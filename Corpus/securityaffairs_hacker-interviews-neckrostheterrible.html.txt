Enjoy the Interview.

You are a popular talented hacker that has already participated in several hacking campaigns, could you tell me more about. 
I been hacking with GhostSquadHackers for long and participated in OpSilence and OpIcarus. I hacked numerous Government websites and ISIS websites.
Could you tell me which his your technical background and when you started hacking? Which are your motivations?
I just fell love with hacking when I started hacking in 2010 and I found fun in hacking websites and servers. Later I started to master programming languages like python, php and c++ and begin writing exploits and 0days for web apps.
What was your greatest hacking challenge? Which was your latest hack? Can you describe me it?
My recent hack is US military leak which covered about 5000 US military personnel information including credit cards details of officials.
What are the 4 tools that cannot be missed in the hacker’s arsenal and why? 
I don’t think tools can make a perfect hacker. It is the hacker who codes tools according to his needs, but for security auditing tools like Nmap, wireshark, burpsuite comes handy.
Which are the most interesting hacking communities on the web today, why? 
There are a lot of hacking communities but Hackforums is still the best.
Did you participate in hacking attacks against the IS propaganda online? When? How?
I have been targeting ISIS websites along with GhostSquadHackers.We have successfully taken down a lot of IS supporting websites and doxed members of isis hacking groups like United Cyber Caliphate.
Where do you find IS people to hack? How do you choose your targets?
We chose our targets based on requests from people getting harassments and also we grab information from hacked IS website databases.
We often hear about cyber weapons and cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. Do you believe it is real the risk of a major and lethal cyber attack against a critical infrastructure?
Attack against infrastructures are one of the great threat of cyber attacks and It is proved by the introduction of virus like Stuxnet which targeted uranium enrichment infrastructure in Iran.
Thanks a lot!
