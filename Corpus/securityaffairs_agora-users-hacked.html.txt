Users of the popular Agora Marketplace have been targeted by unknown crooks who sent them malicious messages trough their PM system. The messages contain a malicious java script exploit that was designed to drain the Bitcoins from the victim’s wallet.
“Immediately after I clicked to open the page, tons of Agora tabs opened up saying “Unable to withdraw amount: 1.0000000”, “Unable to withdraw amount: 2.0000000″, etc. and there were like at least 20 pages with different amounts. 2.0, 0.5, etc. Luckily I had only like $20 in my account.” reported one of the victims in a discussion started on Reddit.
The following image was reported by the popular deepdotweb.com:

When Agora users click the link in the message, the malicious JS code tries to exploit a CSRF vulnerability in the Dark Market to steal users fund from Agora’s wallet as well as changing the users PGP key and reset his PIN code.
As reported by DeepDotWeb, the exploit could be successfully exploited if the following conditions are respected:
The user has to have an active session open with Agora
The user must have JS enabled
See an unknown link and be dumb enough to click on it
The complete code of the malicious exploit is available on Pastebin.
In order for the exploit to work:
Agora users are advised, don’t click on any link in a message, the suggestion is particulrly important for Agora vendors.
