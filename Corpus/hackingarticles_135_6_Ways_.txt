6 Ways to Hack FTP Login Password

In this article, we will learn how to gain control over our victim’s PC through FTP Port. There are various ways to do it and let take time and learn all those because different circumstances call for different measure.
Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more
Now, we need to choose a wordlist. As with any dictionary attack, the wordlist is key. Kali has numerous wordlists built right in.
Run the following command
hydra –L/root/Desktop/user.txt –P /root/Desktop/pass.txt 192.168.1.103 ftp
-L: denotes path for username list
-P:  denotes path for password list
Once the commands are executed it will start applying the dictionary attack and so you will have the right username and password in no time. As you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the FTP username as pavan and password as toor.

This is the graphical version to apply dictionary attack via FTP port to hack a system. For this method to work:
Open xHydra in your kali. And select Single Target option and their give the IP of your victim PC. And select FTP in box against Protocol option and give the port number 21 against the port option.

Now, go to Passwords tab and select Username List and give the path of your text file, which contains usernames, in the box adjacent to it.
Then select Password List and give the path of your text file, which contains all the passwords, in the box adjacent to it.

After doing this, go to Start tab and click on Start button on the left.
Now, the process of dictionary attack will start. Thus, you will attain the username and password of your victim.

 Here 
-U: denotes path for username list

Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer. It supports many protocols: AFP, CVS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP, rlogin, SSH, Subversion, and VNC to name a few

 Patator is a multi-purpose brute-forcer, with a modular design and a flexible usage. It is quite useful for making brute force attack on several ports such as FTP, HTTP, SMB and etc.
patator ftp_login host=192.168.1.103 user=FILE0 0=/root/Desktop/user.txt password=FILE1 1=/root/Desktop/pass.txt

Open Kali terminal type msfconsole
Now type use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login
msf exploit (ftp_login)>set rhosts 192.168.1.103 (IP of Remote Host)
msf exploit (ftp_login)>set user_file  /root/Desktop/user.txt
msf exploit (ftp_login)>set userpass_file  /root/Desktop/pass.txt
msf exploit (ftp_login)>set stop_on_success true
msf exploit (ftp_login)> exploit
 From given below image you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the FTP username and password.
