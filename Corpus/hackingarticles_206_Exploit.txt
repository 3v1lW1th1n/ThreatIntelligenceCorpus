Exploit Windows PC in Network using FreeFloat FTP Server Arbitrary File Upload

This Metasploit module abuses multiple issues in FreeFloat: 1. No credential is actually needed to login; 2. User’s default path is in C:, and this cannot be changed; 3. User can write to anywhere on the server’s file system. As a result of these poor implementations, a malicious user can just log in and then upload files, and let WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the payload uploaded.
