					Police seized two Tor relays investigating WannaCry attack, others disappeared in the same period					
A few days after the massive WannaCry attack the French authorities seized a server running two Tor relays in connection to the ransomware campaign, both relays were also working as Tor entry guard nodes, key components of Tor routing when users connect the anonymizing network.
The server was operated by the French activist Aeris that reported the police’s action through the Tor Project mailing on May 15 asking other Tor operators to revoke trust in the two seized relays.
The server was seized by France’s cyber-crime investigation unit OCLCTIC (L’Office Central de Lutte contre la Criminalité liée aux Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication).

According to Aeris, the police seized the server hosted at hosting company Online SAS, because the traffic associated with WannaCry ransomware that infected a big French company on May 12 was pointing the two Tor relays.
The WannaCry samples that infected the company were communicating with a command and control server hosted on the Tor Network, and it is likely that the server were used as a first hop of the Tor traffic.
“Most Tor servers are configured to log very few details, such as uptime and status metrics, so to safeguard the privacy of its users. Unless Aeris made customizations to default configs, French police have no chance of finding any useful information on the seized servers.” reported Catalin Cimpanu from Bleepingcomputer.com.
Aeris confirmed that tens of other Tor nodes in France disappeared just after the WannaCry attack, he provided Bleeping Computer a list of 30 servers he is currently investigating.
“We have confirmation of 6 Tor nodes seizures [from 5 operators],” the activist told Bleeping Computers. ” A seized relay is not of this list because of hosted on another provider.”
