Video: Vitaly Kamluk on The Equation Group APT
Kaspersky Lab’s global research and analysis team uncovered what they claim is the most sophisticated advanced persistent threat group yet known.
Known as the Equation Group, researchers led by GReAT director Costin Raiu say the threat actors have been operating for 15 years or more and are known to have intercepted and maliciously modified hardware and CDs. Beyond that, the Equation Group is known to have had access to a pair of zero-day vulnerabilities that would eventually be used in the infamous Stuxnet attacks. We caught up with Kaspersky Lab principal security researcher Vitaly Kamluk at the company’s Security Analyst Summit in Cancun, Mexico.
