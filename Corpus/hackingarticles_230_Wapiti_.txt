Wapiti – Web application vulnerability scanner

Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your web applications. It performs “black-box” scans, i.e. it does not study the source code of the application but will scans the WebPages of the deployed webapp, looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data. Once it gets this list, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see if a script is vulnerable.
Wapiti can detect the following vulnerabilities:
Open your backtrack terminal and type
cd /pentest/web/wapiti
Python wapiti.py  http://example.com

The application generates a HTML Report in generated_report/index.html with contains a detailed information about the attacks performed and the vulnerabilities found.
