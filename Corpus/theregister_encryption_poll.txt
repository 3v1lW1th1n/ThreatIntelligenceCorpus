Everything should be encrypted, right?
Workshop Poll Here's the perfect plan to solve all those pesky security problems. Confidentiality and data leakage, secure backups, individual privacy, data integrity, identity and access management - all can be dealt with in some way by encryption. So why don't we all just use it then, and be done?
Of course encryption is out there, embedded in various technologies – every time we see the key in the browser status bar, open a VPN connection or send a signed email, we're using encryption. But there's a massive gulf between this, embedded use and the broader potential for in-your-face, soup-to-nuts data encryption. For example, we have the fact that while hard disk encryption is now available on a variety of desktop and server platforms, it has yet to see widespread deployment outside of certain verticals.
We could have a stab at why this is, but we'd prefer to know what's really behind this absence and we're sure you would too. So, if you have an opinion on data encryption, what's missing and what might change this, please do take five minutes to fill in our short poll. We'd appreciate it and we'll let you know the answers by return.
