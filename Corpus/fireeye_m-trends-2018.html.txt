M-Trends 2018
What have incident responders observed and learned from cyber attacks in 2017? Just as in prior years, we have continued to see the cyber security threat landscape evolve. Over the past twelve months we have observed a number of new trends and changes to attacks, but we have also seen how certain trends and predictions from the past have been confirmed or even reconfirmed.
Our 9thÂ edition of M-Trends draws upon the findings of one year of incident response investigations across the globe. This data provides us with insights into the evolution of nation-state sponsored threat actors, new threat groups, and new trends and attacker techniques we have observed during our investigations. We also compare this data to past observations from prior M-Trends reports and continue our tradition of reporting on key metrics and their development over time.
Some of the topics we cover in the 2018 M-Trends report include:
By sharing this report with the security community, we continue our tradition of providing security professionals with insights and knowledge gained from recent breaches. We hope that you find this report useful in your work to strengthen your security posture and defend against the ever evolving threats.
