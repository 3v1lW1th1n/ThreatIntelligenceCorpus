Dump Cleartext Password in Linux PC using MimiPenguin

Hello friends! Through this article we are introducing a new tool MINIPENUIN between us, which can utilize for fetching login of Linux system in same way as MIMIKATZ. 
A tool to dump the login password from the current linux desktop user. Adapted from the idea behind the popular Windows tool mimikatz.
Takes advantage of clear text credentials in memory by dumping the process and extracting lines that have a high probability of containing cleartext passwords. Will attempt to calculate each word’s probability by checking hashes in /etc/shadow, hashes in memory, and regex searches.
Let’s begin
Open the terminal and type following command to download it from git hub.
Cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin.git

Ls
cd mimipenguin

Now run the bash file to catch the clear text credential
./mimipenguin.sh
