Hi folks,I'm finally in Davis, CA. The trip was very long, about 3300 Miles, 65 driving hours, a huge snow storm in Arizona (Flagstaff) lots of deserts and forests. But everything was amazing.I enjoined a lot the long trip, the fascinating Route66 and the wonderful Painted Desert (Arizona).From Monday I'll start my job in UCDavis.If somebody is planning to come near bayarea please let me know, we may organize something.
