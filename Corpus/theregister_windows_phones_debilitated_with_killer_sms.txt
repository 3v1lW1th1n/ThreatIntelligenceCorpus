Windows Phones message hub hit by killer SMS
A security flaw has been discovered in Microsoft's Windows Phone OS which allows hackers to disable a handset's messaging system by SMS.
A malicious text can be sent which stops the SMS service from working, WinRumours reports. A factory reset is the only way to remedy the issue.
Although the SMS content is hidden from view, the hack can be seen in the video below, where it reboots the device and cuts access to the messaging hub. It can also be triggered by sending a Facebook chat or Windows Live Messenger message.
The hacker who spotted the bug is said to be working directly with Microsoft to resolve the problem.
Text message viruses have been infiltrating smartphones for some time. A couple of years ago, an SMS hack for iPhone was discovered, allowing those who used it access to a device remotely. ®
