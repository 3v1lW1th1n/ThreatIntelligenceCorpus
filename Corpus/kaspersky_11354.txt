Protecting yourself from adware with Kaspersky Internet Security 2016
Sometimes when installing freeware, users rush and often wind up installing “extra” features that can include adware, unnecessary extensions and browser toolbars. It’s quite understandable as anyone can miss one small ticked box in the setup window. However since you didn’t really want these “extras” you’ll probably want to rid of them, right?
In the past we’ve told you about the threats of adware and explained how it could be difficult for a user to remove a toolbar or restore the browser’s initial settings. Adware developers waste no time in advancing their products, so they become increasingly persistent with their efforts. With that in mind, it make you realize that you shouldn’t rush while installing freeware. Instead, practice caution as it can save your valuable time from deleting an annoying extension or bringing your good old homepage back. OK so now we know being safe and cautios is the best practice moving forward, but what if you got caught up installing some “extras” on a recent freeware install?
Kaspersky Lab has you covered with Kaspersky Internet Security 2016. This year’s model of software offers an installation wizard which will hide ad windows and block the installation of any additional programs.

If you are installing several legitimate programs at once, the wizard may also block this process as suspicious. In that case you should teach your wizard a couple of things about your PC habits. To do that, change settings in the System changes control according to your preferences. Follow these easy steps:
Open the Settings window in Kaspersky Internet Security.
Choose Protection -> System changes control.
Tick the boxes you render appropriate.
