Cisco slurps security scanner
Cisco has continued the expansion of its security portfolio with the acquisition of malware analysis outfit ThreatGRID.
The acquisition target was founded in 2012, one of the then-burgeoning number of companies that pushed malware analysis, threat intelligence, and security analytics into the cloud (supplemented by an on-premise appliance).
The newcomer will fit into The Borg's Advanced Malware Protection portfolio, created when it slurped open-source IPS pioneer SourceFire.
In its announcement, Cisco says ThreatGRID “allows enhanced aggregation and correlation of data for advanced threat intelligence across the extended network and across Cisco security solutions and services”.
Cisco has also announced a bunch of other extensions to the AMP suite, including:
Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. ®
