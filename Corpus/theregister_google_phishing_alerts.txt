Google rolls out phishing URL alerts for admins
Google has rolled out a service that alerts administrators when the sites on their networks contain links used in phishing attacks.
The Phishing URL notifications are being added to the Safe Browsing Alerts for Network Administrators, which Google rolled out in September. It sends email to admins of autonomous systems when malicious content is found on their systems.
On Thursday, Google expanded the service. In addition to the new phishing alerts, it also allows admins to receive data in XML formats, making it possible for the data to be processed by scripts. ®
