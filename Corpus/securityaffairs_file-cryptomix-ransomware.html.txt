Security experts from BleepingComputer discovered a new variant of the CryptoMix ransomware that uses a different extension (.FILE)  to append to the file names of the encrypted files and uses new contact emails.
For example, a file encrypted by this variant of ransomware has an encrypted file name of 0D0A516824060636C21EC8BC280FEA12.FILE.
Experts discovered that this variant uses the same encryption methods of previous ones, the ransomware uses the same ransom note is still named _HELP_INSTRUCTION.TXT, but the contact emails to receive the payment instructions are file1@keemail.me, file1@protonmail.com, file1m@yandex.com, file1n@yandex.com, and file1@techie.com.

Further details and the IoCs are included in the post published on Bleeping Computer.
“As we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and decide to pay the ransom, please send us the decryptor so we can take a look at it. You can also discuss or receive support for Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated Cryptomix Help & Support Topic.” wrote Lawrence Abrams.
