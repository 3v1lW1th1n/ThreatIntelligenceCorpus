Weekly Phishing Activity: November 7, 2016

In this week’s phishing activity report, we saw a minimal decrease (<5%) in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. We saw the largest phishing decreases in Computer Hardware (>35%), eCommerce (>35%), and Banking (>15%). Dating Sites (>20%), Electronic Payment Systems (>15%), and Internet and Information Services (>51%) all saw increases in activity.
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
