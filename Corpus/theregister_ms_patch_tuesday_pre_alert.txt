Zero-day IE fix stars in last Patch Tuesday of the decade
Microsoft is lining up a fix for a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer as part of the decade's last ever Patch Tuesday update.
Tuesday is due to bring six bulletins, three of which are critical. The critical fixes address flaws in Windows and Office as well as IE. The Office update covers flaws in Project, Word and Works 8.5.
Only systems running Windows Server 2008 R2 duck the crucial flaws. All other supported operating systems - including Vista and Windows 7 - will need patching against double plus bad vulnerabilities.
The Noughties' last edition of Patch Tuesday covers 12 vulnerabilities in total across six bulletins. Windows systems will need to be rebooted after patches are applied, as explained in a post on Microsoft Security Response blog.
