					DEF CON Talk Will Expose The Latest SMB Vulnerability SMBLoris					
Server Message Block (SMB) has been a foundational piece of Microsoft Windows’ networking all the way back to the LAN Manager days, facilitating “shared access to files, printers and serial ports.” It is so common that a free software implementation called Samba was developed long ago to allow UNIX-like systems to share network resources with Windows systems. It is a rare company that doesn’t have SMB packets running on the network.
