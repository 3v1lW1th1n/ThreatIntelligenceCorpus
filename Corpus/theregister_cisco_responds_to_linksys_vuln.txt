Linksys vuln: Cisco responds
Cisco has identified the Linksys router affected by the vulnerability published by DefenseCode on January 14.
In an e-mail to The Register, the vendor says its review shows the vulnerability only exists in the WRT54GL home router.
“Following our assessment of information recently released by DefenseCode, we have confirmed a vulnerability in the Linksys WRT54GL home router,” the e-mail says. “At this point, no other Linksys products appear to be impacted.
“We have developed and are testing a fix for this issue, and will release it for our customers as soon as possible. Until this time, customers using the WRT54GL can stay safe by ensuring their wireless network is securely configured, and the only people using an Ethernet cable for connecting to the router are friends. Linksys takes the security of our products and customers’ home networks very seriously, and we will continue provide updates as they become available.”
DefenseCode announced the vulnerability, saying it had notified Cisco of the problem. In its original post, the company said it would not publish details of the vulnerability or any exploit until a fix is available. ®
