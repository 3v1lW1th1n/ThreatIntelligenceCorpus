Yet Traveling Time.


During next month (almost all January long) I will be traveling around US between conferences and business meetings. I will flight to New York, after few days I'll be in Koloa (Kauai), Los Angeles, Las Vegas and then back to Sac, my second home ;). For such a  reason it will be difficult keeping updated my blog while I'll be traveling. I'll try to do my best,  but please be patient if you will not see weekly updates ...  Unfortunately I will have only few days (and very busy ones) for each aforementioned place so I cannot organize meetings in Cal as we did last year with SF and SD readers.This is my last post of the year. Lets me say:*UPDATE-1* Today is the last day in New York City. Everything was perfect, thanks to all the friends joined me during the past evenings and to all the ones who got me around the city.
