Swagger staggered as hacker drops dapper code execution cracker
An unpatched remote code execution hole has been publicly disclosed in the popular Swagger API framework, putting users at risk.
The client and server hole (CVE-2016-5641) exists in code generators within the REST programming tool, also know as the OpenAPI Specification.
A module for the popular Metasploit hacking suite has been crafted making exploitation of the flaw easier.
Application security researcher Scott Davis says an injectable parameters in Swagger JSON or YAML files allow remote code execution across NodeJS, PHP, Ruby, and Java.
"By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker can inject arbitrary execution code embedded with a client or server generated automatically to interact with the definition of service," Davis says.
"This is considered an abuse of trust in definition of service, and could be an interesting space for further research."
Swagger maintainers have been quiet, despite the disclosure made last month through US CERT, which was coupled with a patch proffered by Rapid 7.
Other code generation tools may be open to parameter injection, Davis warns.
The Swagger generators are a "powerful" means for organisations to offer developers easy access to their APIs, but many fail to account for malicious Swagger definition documents.
These documents would lead to classic parameter injection.
Users can do little but "carefully inspect Swagger documents" for language-specific escape sequences, until the affected code generators are patched by maintainers. ®
