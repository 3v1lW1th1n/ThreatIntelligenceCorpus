Â Summit Dates: September 6 & 7, 2018Call for Presentations Closes on Monday, March 5, 2018 at 5 p.m CST Submit your presentation hereThe Threat Hunting & Incident Response Summit will focus on specific hunting and incident response techniques and capabilities that can be used to identify, contain, and eliminate adversaries targeting your networks. SANS and our advisory partner Carbon Black are pleased to invite you to the Summit where you will have the opportunity to directly learn from and collaborate with incident response and detection experts who are uncovering and stopping the most recent, sophisticated, and dangerous attacks against organizations.Chances are very high that hidden threats already exist inside your organization's networks. Organizations can't afford to assume that their security measures are impenetrable, no matter how thorough their security precautions might be. Prevention systems alone are insufficient to counter focused human adversaries who know how to get around most security and monitoring tools.The key is to constantly look for attacks that get past security systems, and to catch intrusions in progress rather than after attackers have attained their objectives and done worse damage to the organization. For the incident responder, this process is known as "threat hunting." Threat hunting uses known adversary behaviors to proactively examine the network and endpoints and identify new data breaches.Call for Presentations Closes on Monday, March 5, 2018Submit your presentation hereIf you are interested in presenting, SANS and our advisory partner Carbon Black would be delighted to consider your threat hunting-focused proposal with use cases and communicable lessons.
