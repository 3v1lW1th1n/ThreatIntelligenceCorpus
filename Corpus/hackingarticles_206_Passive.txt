Netdiscover  – Active/Passive ARP Scanner

Netdiscover is an active/passive address reconnaissance tool, mainly developed for those wireless networks without dhcp server, when you are wardriving. It can be also used on hub/switched networks. Built on top of libnet and libpcap, it can passively detect online hosts, or search for them, by actively sending arp requests, it can also be used to inspect your network arp traffic, or find network addresses using auto scan mode, which will scan for common local networks
Open your backtrack terminal and type
netdiscover –I eth2 –r 192.168.0.100/24

Usage:
netdiscover [-i device] [-r range | -p] [-s time] [-n node] [-c count] [-f] [-S]
-i device: your network device
-r range: scan a given range instead of auto scan. 192.168.6.0/24,/16,/8
-p passive mode do not send anything, only sniff
-s time: time to sleep between each arp request (miliseconds)
-c count: number of times to send each arp reques (for nets with packet loss)
-n node: last ip octet used for scanning (from 2 to 253)
-S enable sleep time supression betwen each request (hardcore mode)
-f enable fastmode scan, saves a lot of time, recommended for auto
