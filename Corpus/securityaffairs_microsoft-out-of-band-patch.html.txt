Microsoft released an out-of-band patch to fix a critical security issue in the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library that could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on the targeted machine.
The exploitation of the flaw allows attackers gain complete control over the targeted system.
“There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts,” states the advisory issued by Microsoft.
Microsoft has released security patches to fix the vulnerability (3079904) for all supported versions of the Windows OS.

The advisory confirms that Windows 2003 and Windows XP will not be patched against this vulnerability, only users with extended support will receive the upgrade on these OS.
According to the FireEye firm, the decision to patch all Microsoft OS is a consequence of the disclosure of the exploits used by the Hacking Team.
