Huge XTERM vulnerability.


Hi folks, today I found around the corner a huge XTerm code injection.DECRQSS Device Control Request Status String "DCS $ q" simply echoes(responds with) invalid commands.Exploitability is the same as for the "window title reporting" issuein DSA-380: include the DCS string in an email message to the victim,or arrange to have it in syslog to be viewed by root.So for example: perl -e 'print "\eP\$q\netstat\n\e\\"' > bla.logcat bla.log ; would run the "netstat" command.
