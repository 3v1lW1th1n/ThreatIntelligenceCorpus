The Storm After the Calm: Proofpoint Q3 Threat Summary Tracks Locky Ransomware, Social Threats, BEC, and More
Overview
After a second quarter marked by a significant disruption to the Necurs botnet and associated quiet in malicious document campaigns, the third quarter flipped the script with record-breaking message volumes. While the vast majority of these messages were distributing Locky ransomware, Q3 was also characterized by significant variety and evolution in other types of ransomware and banking Trojans.
On one hand, we observed increasing sophistication in malicious macros with new sandbox evasion techniques and more targeted attacks, as well as shifts in business email compromise (BEC) techniques. On the other hand, the volume of messages distributing Locky ransomware via malicious document attachments and attached JavaScript reached into the hundreds of millions on some days, with actors opting to blanket entire regions with their attacks.
Exploit kit (EK) activity leveled off at dramatically reduced levels from its January peak, but we uncovered malvertising operations leveraging EKs of unprecedented sophistication and scale. At the same time, we observed mobile exploit kits and mobile zero-days beginning to fill the void left by declining desktop EKs. Mobile and social threats related to popular phenomena like Pok√©mon GO and the Rio Olympics also made headlines.
Below are key takeaways from the third quarter of 2016.
