How to Break Router password using Backtrack

Open your Backtrack terminal and Type xhydra and press enter

In the target tab, select
 Single Target: 192.168.1.1
Protocol: http-get

In passwords tab, select
 username: admin (because most of the routers have default username as admin) 
In the passwords, select the password list option and browse to select your passwords file. Here I have used my custom password file.

In Specific tab select
http/https URL: http://192.168.1.1/

Now select start tab and click on start button, the password cracking begins and result is as follows

Open the browser and type http://192.168.1.1/
Put the password u got from xhydra and get administrative access to the router
