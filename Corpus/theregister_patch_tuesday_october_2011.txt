MS wipes out 23 flaws in October's Patch Tuesday
As foreshadowed last week, this month’s round of Microsoft patches focuses on critical vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, .NET and Silverlight.
The IE patch covers eight vulnerabilities that reach all the way up to remote code execution from malicious web pages, and has to be applied to all supported versions from IE6 to IE9. Microsoft’s Jerry Bryant says in the accompanying video that “we are not aware of any attempts to exploit these issues”.
Silverlight and the .NET framework are also vulnerable to remote code-execution from a malicious page – for client systems, via Silverlight or an XAML-capable browser. “Further the issue may allow for code execution on IIS Web servers, if an attacker can upload ASP.NET applications,” Bryant says in the video.
There are two “deployment priority two” patches. One, covering Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, addresses a privilege-escalation issue, the other plugs a remote code execution hole in kernel-mode drivers.
Lower down on the priority list are patches for three remote code execution vulnerabilities in Active Accessibility, Media Center and Forefront UAG respectively, and a patch for a denial-of-service vulnerability in Host Integration Server.
The Media Center and Active Accessibility vulnerabilities both require users to be persuaded to open legitimate files that reside in the same directory as a specially crafted DLL file, while the Forefront UAG would depend on persuading users to visit a crafted URL.
