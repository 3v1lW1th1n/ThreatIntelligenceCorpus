					NSA announces it will stop surveillance activities on emails, texts and other internet communications					

In the past NSA cyber spies were flagging any communication where a foreign surveillance target was mentioned, even when the target wasn’t involved in the conversation.
The NSA reform will involve upstream surveillance collection and not other surveillance activities such as the PRISM program.
“After considerable evaluation of the program and available technology, NSA has decided that its Section 702 foreign intelligence surveillance activities will no longer include any upstream internet communications that are solely “about” a foreign intelligence target.” continue the statement.”Instead, this surveillance will now be limited to only those communications that are directly “to” or “from” a foreign intelligence target. These changes are designed to retain the upstream collection that provides the greatest value to national security while reducing the likelihood that NSA will acquire communications of U.S. persons or others who are not in direct contact with one of the Agency’s foreign intelligence targets.”
The NSA will delete most of the data collected during its surveillance activity.Officially the NSA decided to stop conducting surveillance activities because of
technological
difficulties and to respect the privacy of the US citizens.In many cases, the US intelligence has inadvertently collected citizens’ communications while conducting its surveillance activities.Of course, the NSA statement represents an important success for Privacy advocates.

Edward Snowden defined this reforms the most substantive of the post-2013 NSA reforms.
