Can Blockchain Technology Secure Digital Voting Systems?
Over the past few weeks, teams from 19 universities in the US and UK competed in Kaspersky Lab’s Cybersecurity Case Study Competition, hosted by The Economist’s Which MBA? site. The teams were challenged with a complex task:  
Can technology play a greater positive role in democracy and the way people make important decisions about the future of their countries? With digital voting, a new wave of challenges rolls in: from guaranteeing the anonymity of voters to the prevention of fraud, all the while ensuring the security of the voting system itself. One small vulnerability or oversight could very well change the course of a nation’s history.
Earlier today, Kaspersky Lab announced the winners of the competition. The grand prize winner was New York University, second place was awarded to University of Maryland, College Park and Newcastle University received third place.
“The competition was very interesting and I was very impressed with the submissions,” said Eugene Kaspersky, Chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab. “There was a lot of good work there! The challenges of cybersecurity mean the next generation of experts face a changing frontier – there will be plenty of things to work on and securing digital voting systems for national elections is just one example.”
Kaspersky Lab experts served as the judging panel, selecting the top three proposals out of the 19 submissions. Additional information for each award-winning submission is below:
