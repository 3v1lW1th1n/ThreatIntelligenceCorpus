Password = Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
” reads the blog post.
Of course, security researchers immediately started digging the precious trove of files.


The hacking tools in the Windows folder work against older versions of Windows (Windows XP) and Server 2003.
The folder OddJob contains a Windows implant and includes alleged configuration files and payloads, also in this case targeted versions are older ones like Windows Server 2003 Enterprise up to Windows XP Professional.

The folder includes SQL scripts that could be used to query Oracle Database to obtain a wide range of information, including the list of users and the SWIFT message queries.


“The reports of an alleged hacker-compromised EastNets Service Bureau (ENSB) network is totally false and unfounded,” EastNets’ CEO Hazem Mulhim told Motherboard in an email. “The EastNets Network internal Security Unit has ran a complete check of its servers and found no hacker compromise or any vulnerabilities.” reads the official statement issued by the company.
“The EastNets Service Bureau runs on a separate secure network that cannot be accessed over the public networks. The photos shown on twitter, claiming compromised information, is about pages that are outdated and obsolete, generated on a low-level internal server that is retired since 2013.”
Stay Tuned …
