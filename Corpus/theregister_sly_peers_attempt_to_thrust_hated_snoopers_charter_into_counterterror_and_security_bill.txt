Sly peers attempt to thrust hated Snoopers' Charter into counter-terror and security bill
Britain's ISPs have attacked sneaky, proposed amendments to the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill that were tabled by four peers in Parliament this week – as they mounted an attempt to resurrect the Snoopers' Charter.
Home Secretary Theresa May's draft Communications Data Bill was rejected by politicos in 2012, however, the Tories have repeatedly pushed to greatly enhance surveillance of Brits' online activity, despite opposition from junior Coalition partner the Liberal Democrats.
In recent weeks, following the Paris terror atrocities, Prime Minister David Cameron once again promised to bolster police and spooks' powers to spy on UK netizens if his party wins the General Election in May.
But on Friday, lobby group the Internet Service Providers' Association hit out at the amendments planned by a small group of cross-party peers.
The ISPA said:
Inserting the clauses contained in the draft Communications Data Bill into an already complex bill that is itself proceeding through Parliament via a fast-tracked process is ill-judged.
The Lords cannot have time to properly consider the substantial powers contained in the amendments to the bill, and would deny the Commons the opportunity to properly consider the powers as well.
The Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill, containing 18 pages of amendments (PDF), will be debated in the Palace of Westminster on Monday afternoon.
Concerns, meanwhile, have already been raised by peers sat on the House of Lords Constitution Committee, who recently warned against hastily pushing the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill through Parliament, given the number of "sensitive and controversial provisions contained in earlier legislation that was also fast-tracked." ®
