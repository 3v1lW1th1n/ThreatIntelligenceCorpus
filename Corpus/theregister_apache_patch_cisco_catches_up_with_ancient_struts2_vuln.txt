Apache patch: Cisco catches up with ANCIENT Struts2 vuln
Cisco has issued a patch for a four-year-old Apache Struts2 vulnerability.
The original issue, CVE-2010-1870, was originally reported in July 2010. The vulnerability arises out of how Apache Struts2 handles commands passed to the Object-Graph Navigation Language. As the Apache notification states, “The vulnerability allows a malicious user to bypass the '#'-usage protection built into the ParametersInterceptor, thus being able to manipulate server side context objects.”
Cisco has now confirmed that its Unified Contact Centre Enterprise Environment is subject to the vulnerability.
This could have flow-on effects to other products that use the environment: the Cisco Business Edition 3000 series, the Cisco Identity Services Engine, its Media Experience Engine (MXE) 3500 series, as Cisco writes:
“This vulnerability has been confirmed to allow remote code execution with the privileges of the Administrator user for the Cisco Unified CCE. Exploitation on Cisco ISE, Cisco MXE 3500, and Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series is theoretically possible but could not be reproduced. Cisco recommends that customers affected by this vulnerability upgrade to a fixed software release version.”
There are fixes for all but the Business Edition 3000 products. The Borg suggests users of those products contact it to discuss their options. ®
