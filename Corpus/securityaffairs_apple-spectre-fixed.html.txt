					Apple released patches to fix Spectre flaws in Safari, macOS, and iOS					
On Monday, Apple released patches to fix Spectre flaws in Safari, macOS, and iOS, the tech giant released iOS 11.2.2 software a macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 supplemental update. The patches also fixed vulnerabilities in Apple WebKit, the web browser engine used by Safari, Mail, and App Store.
The security updates issued by Apple aim to mitigate the two known methods for exploiting Spectre identified as “bounds check bypass” (CVE-2017-5753/Spectre/v1) and “branch target injection” (CVE-2017-5715/Spectre/v2).
Just after the disclosure of the Meltdown and Spectre attacks, Apple released security updates (iOS 11.2, macOS and tvOS 11.2) to protect its systems against Meltdown attacks.
Apple now released the following security updates:
After the disclosure of the flaws, security experts pointed out that the Spectre vulnerability is very hard to patch, but fortunately, the exploitation is much more difficult than Meltdown.
Another worrisome aspect of the Spectre attacks is that it breaks the isolation between different applications opening the door to remote attacks, for example, an attacker can remotely bypass sandboxing mechanism implemented by modern browsers.
