“A small percentage of current and former Uber driver partner names and driver’s license numbers were contained in the database,” the statement, posted by Katherine Tassi, Uber’s Managing Counsel of Data Privacy, wrote. “Immediately upon discovery we changed the access protocols for the database, removing the possibility of unauthorized access. We are notifying impacted drivers, but we have not received any reports of actual misuse of information as a result of this incident.”
As part of the incident response procedure the experts of the company notified the data breach to the authorities and they have changed the access protocols for the database, removing the possibility of unauthorized access.
