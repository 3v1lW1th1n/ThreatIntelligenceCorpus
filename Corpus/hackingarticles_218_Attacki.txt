Attacking on Remote PC using Adobe Flash Player 11.3 Font Parsing Code Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability found in the ActiveX component of Adobe Flash Player before 11.3.300.271. By supplying a corrupt Font file used by the SWF, it is possible to gain arbitrary remote code execution under the context of the user, as exploited in the wild.
Adobe Flash Player before 11.3.300.271.
