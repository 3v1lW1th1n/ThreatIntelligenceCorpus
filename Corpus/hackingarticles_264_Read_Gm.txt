Read Gmail mail with Right Click

Go to your Gmail page
in the top right side of the Gmail page, click on “Settings” 

In the Settings box that opens, click on “Labs.”

 Scroll down the list of options until you come to “Message Sneak Peek.” (It was a long way down on my system.)
Click “Enable.” 

You can view any email message with a right-click but this feature won’t work inside the “Spam” folder though it works for Trash.
