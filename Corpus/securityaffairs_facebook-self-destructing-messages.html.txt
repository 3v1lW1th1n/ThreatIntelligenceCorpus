This is the silent war of the social media, now Facebook is planning to offer its users a Snapchat-like feature in its Messenger app, the company is implementing the Self-Destructing Messages.
The new feature will allow Facebook users to send self-destructing messages.
Snapchat is a video messaging application that allows sending videos and messages, dubbed “Snaps,” that recipients can view for a limited time, it has been estimated that in May 2015 the app’s users were sending 2 billion photos and videos per day.
Users can enable the self-destructing message by tapping the hourglass icon on the top-right corner of the Messenger conversation. Enabling this mode Facebook sets the messages to self-destruct after an hour. To restore Facebook Messenger normal behavior user has to tap again the hourglass icon.
At the time I’m writing, the feature is only available to a limited number of French users.
