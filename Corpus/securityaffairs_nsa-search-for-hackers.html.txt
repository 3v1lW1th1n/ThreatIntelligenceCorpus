The President of the United States of America, Barack Obama approved the law to give to NSA wider powers, where the NSA is able to spy internet traffic in search of hackers, responsible of attacks against the US.
But in practice, what does this means?
Based on documents leaked by Snowden It means that if so NSA can examine internet data without needing a warrant in their search to find malware and cyber criminals related with foreign governments.
The Justice Department permitted the spy agency to track online activities to recognize patterns related to malicious activities that the NSA could trace back to foreign state-sponsored-hackers.

It means that besides the fact that NSA can spy to trace attacks back to foreign governments, they can also spy on a specific online target, even if this target isn’t linked with malicious actives.
Brain Hale, spokesman for the office of the Director of National Intelligence said,
“Against that backdrop, it should come as no surprise that the US government gathers intelligence on foreign powers that attempt to penetrate US networks and steal the private information of US citizens and companies,” “As we’ve publicly stated, targeting overseas individuals engaging in hostile cyber activities on behalf of a foreign power is a lawful foreign intelligence purpose.”
The good news is that this week was voted a law to limit the power of the NSA and their spying program, which marked the first time since 9/11 that a law came out to restrict surveillance.
