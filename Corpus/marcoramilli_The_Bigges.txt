The Biggest App Sec Mistakes Companies Make


His folks, today I would share some thoughts about the "mistake that company often do on computer security" . Mu thoughts on that topic have been published on veracode website. Directly from veracode:Veracode Marketing recently polled a list of InfoSec luminaries, asking them “What is the biggest mistake companies make with Application Security and how can they fix it?” We’re pleased to present the responses from a wide array of security experts including Bill Brenner of CSO Magazine, Andrew Hay of the 451 Group, Jack Daniel of Tenable Network Security and Veracode’s own, Chris Wysopal. While all our experts have their unique perspectives, some common themes arose including the basic idea of taking application security more seriously and committing to a programmatic approach vs. ad hoc manual testing. We want to thank all our respondents for participating and we welcome your thoughts too – use our comment area and tell us, “What do you think is the biggest appsec mistake companies are making today?”Is your company actually doing these mistakes too? If you are interested in sharing opinions about that or you want your thoughts don't  esitate to contact me.
