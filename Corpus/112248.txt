Google Fixes Dozens of Bugs in Chrome 42
Google has released Chrome 42, a major security upgrade to theÂ browser that includes patches for 45 vulnerabilities.
The latest version of Chrome carries with it fixes for a number of high-severity bugs, including a cross-origin bypass in the HTML parser. That vulnerability earned an anonymous security researcher a reward of $7,500 from Google. In all, the company paid out more than $21,000 in rewards to external researchers who reported bugs fixed in this version.
Among the other serious flaws patched in Chrome 42 is a use-after-free in the IPC component of the browser and a type confusion bug in the V8 engine. There also is a cross-origin bypass in the Blink layout engine, for which Google paid a $4,000 reward to researcher Amitay Dobo.
