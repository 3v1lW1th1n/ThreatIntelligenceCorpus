Metasploit Tutorial for Beginners (Part 1)

The Metasploit Project is an open-source, computer security project which provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development. Its most well-known sub-project is the Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.
Metasploit helps security and IT professionals identify security issues, verify vulnerability mitigations, and manage expert-driven security assessments.

Vulnerability: Vulnerability is a security hole in a piece of software, hardware or operating system that provides a potential angle to attack the system. Vulnerability can be as simple as weak passwords or as complex as buffer overflows or SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Exploit: “Exploit” refers to a well-known bug/hole that hackers can use to gain entry into the system.To take advantage of vulnerability, you often need an exploit, a small and highly specialized computer program whose only reason of being is to take advantage of a specific vulnerability and to provide access to a computer system. 
Payload: A payload is the piece of software that lets you control a computer system after it’s been exploited. The payload is typically attached to and delivered by the exploit.
