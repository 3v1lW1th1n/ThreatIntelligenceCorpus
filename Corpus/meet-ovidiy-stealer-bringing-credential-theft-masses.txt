Meet Ovidiy Stealer: Bringing credential theft to the massesOverviewProofpoint threat researchers recently analyzed Ovidiy Stealer, a previously undocumented credential stealer which appears to be marketed primarily in the Russian-speaking regions. It is under constant development, with several updated versions appearing since the original samples were observed in June 2017. The growing number of samples demonstrate that criminals are actively adopting this malware. Ovidiy Stealer is priced at 450-750 Rubles (~$7-13 USD) for one build, a price that includes a precompiled executable that is also "crypted" to thwart analysis and detection.It should be noted that some antivirus solutions are detecting Ovidiy Stealer with generic and heuristic signatures only. With only heuristic detection, it is possible that an AV solution will detect the behavior of Ovidiy Stealer but label it in logs with a generic description and thus SOC analysts monitoring alerts may well see the event but not recognize its significance. Instead, Ovidiy Stealer could be active an organization's network, throwing alerts but not identified specifically.DistributionWe believe that Ovidiy Stealer is currently being spread via email as executable attachments, compressed executable attachments, and links to an executable download. It is also likely spread via file hosting / cracking / keygen sites, where it poses as other software or tools. In several cases, we observed the Ovidiy Stealer bundled with a “LiteBitcoin” installer, further validating this claim.Figure 1: This file, spread as “litebitcoin-qt.zip,” bundles Ovidiy Stealer and another RAT, Remote Manipulator System by TektonIT. While the software is installing both malware samples begin to reach out to the Command and Control (C&C) servers ovidiystealer[.]ru and rmansys[.]ru.[Update 7/14/2017: The content of this site has been removed since this article was published. The site itself appears to still be online.] Figure 2: This file, spread as “Chase SoftWare 1.2 Jora.exe” appears to be an account checker for various financial institutions (that is, a hacking tool), that was bundled with Ovidiy Other observed filenames are listed below and include game lures, hack tool lures, social network lures and others:●HideMiner.zip●VkHackTool.zip●update_teamspeak3.5.1.exe●WORLD OF TANKS 2017.txt.exe●dice_bot.exe●cheat v5.4.3 2017.exe●Vk.com BulliTl.exeAnalysisAt the time of writing, we have observed versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.5 distributed in the wild. Ovidiy Stealer is written in .NET and most samples are packed with with either .NET Reactor or Confuser. Upon execution the malware will remain in the directory in which it was installed, and where it will carry out tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no persistence mechanism built into this malware, so on reboot it will cease to run, but the file will remain on the victim machine.Ovidiy Stealer is modular and contains functionality to target a multiple applications -- primarily browsers -- listed below.Because a separate module carries out the targeting of each application, the fewer the modules selected, the smaller the malware payload size. Buyers can select as few as a single module, for example just “Google Chrome”.Figure 3: Example code displaying the targeted directories for Chromium based browsersFigure 4: Example displaying the code for locating and stealing stored FileZilla passwordsOvidiy Stealer utilizes SSL/TLS for communication with its command and control server. It currently utilizes the domain ovidiystealer[.]ru for its command and control (C&C) communications; which is is also the domain used to market and sell the malware. The initial C&C beacon is a POST reporting the following details:Figure 5: Network traffic capture of initial checkin beacon generated by the stealerThe unique ID provided for each infected machine is a combination of the 8 character DiskID and 16 character ProcessorID, combined into one string. We observed a commonly hardcoded ProcessorID of “BFEBFBFF000206A7” being used if the function checking the ProcessorID resulted in an empty buffer, and at least one sample containing “Rofl” for that value. Ovidiy Stealer traffic also includes a hardcoded User-Agent “E9BC3BD76216AFA560BFB5ACAF5731A3”. This is the md5 hash of the phrase 'litehttp', which is also the default User-Agent of the open-source LiteHTTP Bot.[1]. We believe that Ovidiy author reused the open-source code of the LiteHTTP Bot project.Figure 6: Code reuse shown: Ovidiy Stealer on the left, LiteHTTP Bot on the rightIf the stealer is able to find passwords from targeted applications, it will follow up its initial checkin with another request reporting the passwords of targeted applications:Figure 7: Network traffic capture of credentials exfiltration beacon generated by the stealerSales and SupportOvidiy Stealer is offered for sale on ovidiystealer[.]ru, a domain which will help attract potential customers and, as noted above, also the C&C domain. The malware boasts support, features, and login access to the web panel. The admin panel for Ovidiy Stealer allows the botmaster to view statistics on infected machines, view logs, build more stubs, and manage the account.Figure 8: Ovidiy Stealer website landing page. Note the “We accept Free-Kassa” button.Figure 9: Ovidiy Stealer admin panelFrom the admin console, the botmaster has the capabilities to view and filter logs from infected machines.Figure 10: Viewing Ovidiy Stealer client logsTo simplify purchasing, the team behind Ovidiy Stealer uses a service known as 'RoboKassa' to collect payment for new stubs. RoboKassa is a Russian equivalent to PayPal, allowing users to conduct payment using credit cards and other types of payment to the sellers; in this case the seller is “Ovidiy” (Fig. 11).Figure 11: Payment via RoboKassa offering several optionsLike many other markets with many choices, the malware market is competitive and developers must market the strengths and benefits of their products in order to attract buyers. To help drive sales, the development team includes statistics on the progress of certain modules, and other plans for future releases of the malware. In addition, the site includes “testimonials" from satisfied customers, presumably to demonstrate to other would-be criminals that they can be profitable when using Ovidiy Stealer.Figure 12: Reviews and development progress. The user ACE’s comments translate to English as: “I only need the stealer for burglary on order. I explain what it is: I accept an order for the hijacking of a certain person's account. After I work with him and install the stealer. That's all, for one order I get 300-500 rubles. Without this project it would be impossible! Thank you!”The main author of this project goes by the handle "TheBottle," evident from the informational page of the Ovidiy Stealer website. Moreover, the name 'TheBottle' is observed in at least one sample's PDB string:C:\Users\TheBottle\documents\visual studio 2017\Projects\Ovidiy\Ovidiy\obj\Debug\Ovidiy.pdbFigure 13: Self proclaimed author of Ovidiy Stealer, ‘TheBottle’, translated to EnglishConclusionOvidiy Stealer is a new password stealer that entered the criminal ranks barely one month ago. While it is not the most advanced stealer we have seen, marketing and an entry-level price scheme make it attractive and accessible to many would-be criminals. Ovidiy Stealer is lightweight and simple enough to work with relative ease, allowing for simple and efficient credential exfiltration. A lightweight, easy-to-use, and effective product coupled with frequent updates and a stable support system give Ovidiy Stealer the potential to become a much more widespread threat. Stolen credentials continue to be a major risk for individuals and organizations, because password re-use can enable one stolen login to compromise several more accounts, and the sale of stolen accounts continues to be a lucrative market for criminal looking for quick profits. Ovidiy Stealer highlights the manner in the cybercrime marketplace drives innovation and new entrants and challenges organizations that must keep pace with the latest threats to their users, their data, and their systems. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)IOCIOC TypeDescriptionovidiystealer.ruDomainOvidiy Stealer C&C7de66557dacbabe5228faa294c357ad02c9f07eb2395229f209776bc9a09dfb4SHA256Litebitcoin-qt.zip Ovidiy Stealer3ddc17470fb86dcb4b16705eb78bcbcb24dce70545f512ce75c4a0747474ef52SHA256Chase SoftWare 1.2 Jora.exe Ovidiy Stealer5a44126ea4c5c9bbc3c44fec0346c3071b55fb6abb10ad3299590a3b0e2a8fc7SHA256Uber.exe Ovidiy Stealer8d70877b4014a726e64d3338c454489628a78dcee3e533152ff2223e3bdec506SHA256Ovidiy Stealerd469e7f2531eed4c3f418a71acdbd08dd167409047812ab78f5407730d077792SHA256Ovidiy Stealerd5711ac689d2cae77d19fab19768870adec983e4cdbd04f58d77828ef61eec88SHA256Ovidiy Stealera18fce17e57b324b8552ac8ff34a912a6788be028988288d9b6752c7911a0936SHA256Ovidiy Stealerc16408967de0ca4d3a1d28530453e1c395a5166b469893f14c47fc6683033cb3SHA256Ovidiy Stealer255899d86d58a95499473046fcb6ad821ac500af8679635487d9003ba0f7b3ecSHA256Ovidiy Stealer2a54eb17cc418da37fa3a45ceb840882bf1800909753e6431c2e3b0fcef4308aSHA256Ovidiy Stealer84097d78bc73c9d8b4d7f4751c0dbb79da5d8883bd0fd27194cc21e05fdbca04SHA256Ovidiy Stealerc0bf76eee1a42607236652151e1ff67a5e058e780e487d18e946dad6c2084f5dSHA256Ovidiy Stealerd733dbd549111ecfb732da39bd67d47c631a0b15b2fb4e8ff446b63088cd4ed4SHA256Ovidiy Stealer062bd1d88e7b5c08444de559961f68694a445bc69807f57aa4ac581c377bc432SHA256Ovidiy Stealer80d450ca5b01a086806855356611405b2c87b3822c0c1c38a118bca57d87c410SHA256Ovidiy Stealer22fc445798cd3481018c66b308af8545821b2f8f7f5a86133f562b362fc17a05SHA256Ovidiy Stealer8542a49b3b927d46fefae743b61485004a3540a4e204ee882028a85f08f4b3eeSHA256Ovidiy StealerET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Coverage 2827113 | Observed DNS Query to Ovidiy Stealer CnC Domain
