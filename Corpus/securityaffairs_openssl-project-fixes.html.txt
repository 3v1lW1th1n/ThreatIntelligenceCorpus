					OpenSSL Project plans to patch soon High Severity Vulnerabilities					
The OpenSSL Project announced this week that it will release security patches for several vulnerabilities affecting the popular crypto library.
The OpenSSL Project plans to release the patches on May 3, the list of vulnerabilities that will be fixed includes also High Severity flaws.
The OpenSSL versions 1.0.0 and 0.9.8 are no longer supported, this means that they will not receive any security updates in the future, meanwhile, the support for version 1.0.1 will end on December 31, 2016.
The users have noted that this is the third update for the OpenSSL crypto library issued in this year. Earlier this year the OpenSSL Project released versions 1.0.2f and 1.0.1r to fix a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2016-0701) that allows attackers to decrypt secure traffic. The developers also patched two separate vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, the most severe affected the implementations of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm presents only in OpenSSL version 1.0.2.

Another round of security updates released in March fixed vulnerabilities, including the DROWN flaw that could be exploited by attackers to access users’ sensitive data over secure HTTPS communications. In March, security experts estimated that the DROWN vulnerabilities affected a quarter of the top one million HTTPS domains and one-third of all HTTPS websites at the time of disclosure.
