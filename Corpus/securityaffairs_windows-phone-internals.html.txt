We have spoken several times about jailbreaking and rooting activities explaining that these procedures allow to remove hardware restrictions implemented by the Apple and Google operating systems to give users root access allowing to download and install applications and themes from third-party stores.
But, what about Windows mobile devices?
Now, Windows users can now root their Windows Phones with the first Windows Phone root called Windows Phone Internals that was designed by Healthcliff74 (@Heathcliff74XDA).

Windows Phone Internals allows to unlock bootloaders of Windows Lumia and gain root access on the mobile, allowing to flash custom ROMs. This means that Windows Phone developer community will start developing good quality ROMs like the Android community does.

Healthcliff74 has launched a website dedicated to Windows Phone Internals with the intent to support users in rooting their devices.
“I am proud to announce the immediate availability of Windows Phone Internals 1.0. This tool allows you to unlock the bootloader of selected Lumia Windows Phone models. After unlocking the bootloader, you can enable Root Access on the phone or create and flash Custom ROM’s. I created a short introduction video to show the features of the tool.” said Healthcliff74.
In the following video is explained how to enable Root Access on Windows Phones and how to reate a Custom ROM.

The Windows Phone Internals tool works on most versions of Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile.
Users can download and test the Windows Phone Internals on their device, but they have to consider that the operation has some risks to consider, such as the possibility to brick the Windows Phone.
Enjoy it!
