World of Warcraft pet scam
Virtual goods are becoming more and more popular with cybercriminals, who are aiming more and more scams at gamers. Crooks have taken a renewed shine to World of Warcraft, as we see with a scam offering free in-game pets. The scam part? You don’t actually get the pet, and your account details are stolen.
Most ardent fans of Warcraft know that the only place to get virtual pets is from the official store, but a newly discovered phishing campaign seeks to lure players into handing over their battle.net account info. The accounts are, presumably, then sold on in the black market for a tidy sum.
Although the “gift” aspect gives this scam a slightly different twist, the results are the same: loss of personal info and account theft. As ever, the best thing to do with these sorts of emails is to delete and report them.
