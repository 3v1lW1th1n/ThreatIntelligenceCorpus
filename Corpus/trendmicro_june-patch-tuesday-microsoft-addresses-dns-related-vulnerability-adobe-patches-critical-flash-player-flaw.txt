June Patch Tuesday: Microsoft Addresses DNS-related Vulnerability, Adobe Patches Critical Flash Player Flaw
This month’s Patch Tuesday entry patched a number of significant vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-8225, a remote code execution vulnerability that occurs when the Windows Domain Name System (DNS) component DNSAPI.dll fails to handle DNS responses properly. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can use a variety of methods such as man-in-the-middle attacks or DNS server manipulation to execute code at the local level.
The June Patch Tuesday addresses another critical remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2018-8231, which affects the HTTP Protocol stack component Http.sys used to process HTTP requests at high speed. Microsoft notes that exploitation of this vulnerability involves an unauthenticated attacker sending a specially crafted packet to a targeted Http.sys server. If successful, the attacker then gains control of the targeted system.
CVE-2018-8267, which was publicly disclosed via Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative back in January 2018, is another noteworthy vulnerability addressed this month. The vulnerability occurs due to the way the scripting engine handles error objects. It can be exploited with compromised websites or specially crafted applications, documents, and other content to allow an attacker to take control of the targeted computer.
In addition to CVE-2018-8267, the following vulnerabilities were also disclosed via ZDI:
In line with Microsoft’s release, Adobe also published their set of updates for vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Flash Player 29.0.0.171 and earlier versions in the APSB18-19 Security Bulletin. The most critical Flash Player vulnerability addressed is CVE-2018-5002, a stack-based buffer overflow that could result in remote code execution performed by an attacker. This vulnerability is reportedly being actively used in targeted attacks.
