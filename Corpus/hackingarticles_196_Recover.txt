Recover Deleted Data from Remote Victim PC

This module list and try to recover deleted files from NTFS file systems. Use the FILES option to guide recovery. Let it empty to enumerate deleted files in the DRIVE. Set FILES to an extension (Ex. “pdf”) to recover deleted files with that extension. Or set FILES to a comma separated list of IDs (from enumeration) to recover those files. The user must have into account file enumeration and recovery could take a long time, use the TIMEOUT option to abort enumeration or recovery by extension after that time (in seconds).
