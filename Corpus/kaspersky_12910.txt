My smartphone, my friend
We are pretty sure you have a smartphone. Right now, while you are reading this article, it’s on your table, or in your pocket, or, maybe, in your hand. You trust it a lot: It knows all of your friends and relatives; it holds your e-mails and other messages, helps you navigate home, and wakes you up in the morning. It knows your schedule and might even have access to your bank accounts.
Your smartphone is an important part of your life. But can you say how important it actually is to you? Is it more important than your friends? How long can you live without it?
