Author: Robert McDaniel
 

In this week’s phishing report, we saw more than a >15% increase in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Banking (>130%), eCommerce (>170%), and Computer Software (>70%) saw large spikes in phishing activity last week.  We saw a decrease in phishing activity for Electronic Payment Systems (>15%) and Internet Content Providers (>15%).

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
