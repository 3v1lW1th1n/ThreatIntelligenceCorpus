HP cloud gets crucial fed security certification
HP's virtual private cloud technology is now FedRAMP compliant, making it easier for US government agencies to consume the company's cloud computing services.
The announcement of FedRAMP compliance was made by HP on Friday, and follows the Amazon Web Services cloud gaining FedRAMP in mid-May.
With FedRAMP compliance, HP's virtual private cloud offering can now more easily be consumed by government agencies, which would otherwise each have to conduct lengthy security evaluations for each contract.
By being granted a provisional Authority to Operate (pATO) from the federal government's Joint Authorization Board (JAV), other government agencies can grant their own ATO via HP's pATO.
"The high sensitivity of the data stored in the cloud requires government CIOs and IT managers to adopt cloud solutions that are trustworthy, reliable and consistent," Marilyn Crouther, general manager, US Public Sector, HP Enterprise Services, said in a canned statement. "FedRAMP authorization represents a critical milestone in HP's efforts to deliver a secure converged cloud to our US government clients".
With both HP and Amazon now FedRAMP compliant, the absence of Google, Microsoft, Rackspace, and IBM from the certification is more and more perplexing. None of those companies have recieved FedRAMP compliance yet, we understand. FedRAMP was first announced in 2010 and certifications to operate began being dolled out in 2013. ®
