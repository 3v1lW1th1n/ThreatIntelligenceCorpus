Embedded Backdoor with Image using FakeImageExploiter

In this article we are introducing a newly launched hacking tool “Fake Image Exploiter”. It is design so that it becomes easier for attackers to perform phishing or social engineering attacks by generating a fake image with hidden malicious .bat/.exe file inside it.
Let’s start!
Open the terminal inside your kali Linux and type following command to download it from github.
Git clone https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/FakeImageExploiter.git

Once it gets downloaded then opens the folder and selects the file “settings” for configuration before running the program as shown the given screenshot.

Now made some changes inside setting file as shown the screenshot:
Here you have to declare the type of payload extension you will use to hide it inside the image. You can set any exetension among these four : ps1, bat, txt, exe.  I had set PAYLOAD_EXETNSION=bat similarly set BYPASS_RH=NO  and scroll down for next configration.

In same way set these two values also as shown in screenshot then save the changes.
AUTO_PAYLOAD_BUILD=YES
AGENT_HANLER_PORT=4444

After making certain changes in setting file then open the terminal and run the program file:
Cd FakeImageExploiter
./ FakeImageExploiter.sh

Click on YES to execute framework.

Select payload to build as I had choose window/meterpreter/reverse_tcp for attack.

After then a pop up box will open which will allow choosing any jpg image so that it could hide .bat file payload inside that image.

Now select icon for your malicious image. 

Give a name to your payload which will be display to victim as file name, from screenshot you can see I had given sales.

Now it generates a link as you can observe it from highlighted part of screenshot and then send this link to victim. Now victim will download the zip file and click on the sales.jpg.

When victim will click on sales.jpg, we will get meterpreter session at the background on metasploit framework.
