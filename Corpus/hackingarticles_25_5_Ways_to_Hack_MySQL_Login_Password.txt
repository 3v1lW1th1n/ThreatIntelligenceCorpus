5 Ways to Hack MySQL Login Password

In this article, we will learn how to gain control over our victim’s PC through mysql service via port 3306. There are various ways to do it and let take time and learn all those because different circumstances call for different measure.
Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer. It supports many protocols: AFP, CVS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP, rlogin, SSH, Subversion, and VNC to name a few
Run the following command
Medusa  -h 192.168.1.106 –U /root/Desktop/user.txt –P /root/Desktop/pass.txt –M mysql
 Here 
-U: denotes path for username list
-P:  denotes path for password list
As you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the mysql username as root and password as toor.

Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. 
Run the following command
ncrack –v –U /root/Desktop/user.txt–P /root/Desktop/pass.txt 192.168.1.106:3306
 Here 
-U: denotes path for username list
-P:  denotes path for password list
As you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the mysql username as root and password as toor.

This is the graphical version to apply dictionary attack via 3306 port to hack a system. For this method to work:
Open xHydra in your kali. And select Single Target option and their give the IP of your victim PC. And select MYSQL in box against Protocol option and give the port number 3306 against the port option.

Now, go to Passwords tab and select Username List and give the path of your text file, which contains usernames, in the box adjacent to it.
Then select Password List and give the path of your text file, which contains all the passwords, in the box adjacent to it.

After doing this, go to Start tab and click on Start button on the left.
Now, the process of dictionary attack will start. Thus, you will attain the username and password of your victim.

Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more
Now, we need to choose a wordlist. As with any dictionary attack, the wordlist is key. Kali has numerous wordlists built right in.
Run the following command
hydra –L/root/Desktop/user.txt –P /root/Desktop/pass.txt 192.168.1.106 mysql
-L: denotes path for username list
-P:  denotes path for password list
Once the commands are executed it will start applying the dictionary attack and so you will have the right username and password in no time. As you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the mysql username as root and password as toor.

This module simply queries the MySQL instance for a specific user/pass (default is root with blank).
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login
msf auxiliary(mysql_login) > set rhosts 192.168.1.106
msf auxiliary(mysql_login) > set user_file /root/Desktop/users.txt
msf auxiliary(mysql_login) > set pass_file /root/Desktop/password.txt
msf auxiliary(mysql_login) > set stop_on_success true
msf auxiliary(mysql_login) > run
This will start brute force attack and try to match the combination for valid username and password using user.txt and pass.txt file.
From given image you can observe that our mysql server is not secure against brute force attack because it is showing matching combination of username: root and password: toor for login.
Once the attacker retrieves the valid credential he can directly login into mysql server for stealing or destroying the database information.
