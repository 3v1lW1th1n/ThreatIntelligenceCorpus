					The OpenSSL Project fixed a High Severity flaw CVE-2017-3733 in release 1.1.0					
The OpenSSL development team has fixed a high severity denial-of-service (DoS) flaw tracked as CVE-2017-3733. This is the second security update released in just two months, the first one addressed four low and moderate severity flaws in the library.
The flaw was reported by Joe Orton of Red Hat on January 31, it has been described as  “Encrypt-Then-Mac renegotiation crash.”
“During a renegotiation handshake if the Encrypt-Then-Mac extension is negotiated where it was not in the original handshake (or vice-versa) then this can cause OpenSSL to crash (dependent on ciphersuite). Both clients and servers are affected,” reads the advisory published by the OpenSSL Project. 

The issue was fixed with the release of the OpenSSL version 1.1.0e, the development team confirmed that it doesn’t affect the OpenSSL 1.0.2. The version Version 1.0.2 has a long term support (LTS) date of December 31, 2019, and there are no plans for a 1.0.3 release.
Let’s remind that versions 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8 are no more supported and will not receive security updates.
