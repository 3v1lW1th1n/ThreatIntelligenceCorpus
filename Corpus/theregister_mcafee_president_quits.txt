McAfee head vanishes, replaced by two more
McAfee has decided that it needs two presidents – namely Michael DeCesare and Todd Gebhert – to replace David DeWalt, who is quitting the firm.
The Intel-owned vendor said it is creating an office of the president for the duo, who will report to Renee James, senior veep and GM at Chipzilla and chairman of McAfee.
In a blurb about the appointments, James said: "With the formation of the office of the president, we have two proven executives with long histories of accomplishment and leadership at McAfee".
He added that taskmaster Intel is happy with sales out and product developments at the sMcAfee since its acquisition.
DeCesare pitched up at McAfee in 2007 and was most recently in charge of global operations including manufacturing, channels, and consulting services. Gebhart managed vendor partnerships, direct and web sales.
After four years in charge, DeWalt will operate as a non-employee member of McAfee's board. In additional blurb, he said: "I'll be leaving McAfee in great hands." ®
