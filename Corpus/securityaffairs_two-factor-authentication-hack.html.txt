					How to bypass two-factor authentication with a text message					
Following the recent data breaches suffered by IT giants (e.g. MySpace, LinkedIn, Twitter) security experts are inviting users to avoid sharing login credentials on multiple websites and to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) when it is available.
Is Two-factor authentication the solution for any kind of hacks?
Of course no, it is important to assume the proper security posture being aware of the threats, two-factor authentication processes could be bypassed in various ways, for example by using malware or through social engineering attacks.

2FA drastically improve security, even when hackers steal your password they need a second factor to complete the authentication process.
Unfortunately, they can obtain this precious information by tricking victims into disclosing it.
Earlier this week, the security expert Alex MacCaw, co-founder of the Clearbit firm, warned of an attack technique observed in real attacks aiming to trick users into disclosing a two-factor authentication (2FA) code on a Google account.

Below the technique step by step:
You are thinking that attackers need to have login credentials of the victims, but this is not a problem because the criminal underground is fueled by data leaked after numerous data breaches.
In many cases, the leaked dumps include the mobile phone number of the victims, for this reason, it is a joke for hackers to target you.
The attack method is not new, periodically we see threat actors to adopt it. In most sophisticated attacks the hackers spoof their identity to make more realistic the messages sent to the victims.
Today we have learned another important lesson, never text our two-factor authentication codes to anyone, even if they pretend to appear a legitimate service.
