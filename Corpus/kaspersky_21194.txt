Quiz: Is that really cryptocurrency?
The world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain valuables abides by its own rules. The names of some altcoins (that’s all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin) sound like Internet memes, yet on occasion, memes themselves inspire cryptocurrencies. And sometimes, the sane reaction to the launch of a new cryptocurrency is: You’ve gotta be kidding me! Has the world finally gone mad, or are these strange entities really our financial future?
We invite you to take our quiz (no googling, please), and find out what you know about cryptocurrencies. Can you distinguish real cryptocurrencies from popular online memes?
