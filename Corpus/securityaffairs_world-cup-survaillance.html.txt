Russia World Cup 2018 – Mobile devices and computers of football fans traveling to Russia could be hacked by the Russian Intelligence, the alert was issued by William Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center.
The Top US official warned of massive surveillance operated by Russian authorities during the World Cup for security reason.
“Anyone traveling to Russia to attend the World Cup should be clear-eyed about the cyber risks involved,” Evanina said in a statement.
“If you’re planning on taking a mobile phone, laptop, PDA, or other electronic device with you — make no mistake — any data on those devices (especially your personally identifiable information) may be accessed by the Russian government or cyber criminals.”

Every traveler attending the event in Russia should be a target of the Russian Intelligence, to prevent nation-state hackers compromise their devices the official suggests removing the battery when it is not in use.
“Corporate and government officials are most at risk, but don’t assume you’re too insignificant to be targeted.”
