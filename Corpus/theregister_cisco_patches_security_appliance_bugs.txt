Cisco patches security appliance bugs
It's Borg Bug Day, and this week Cisco's issued patches of interest to users of its Adaptive Security Appliances (ASAs).
The two newly-announced bugs are CVE-2016-1379, a VPN block memory exhaustion vulnerability; and CVE-2016-1385, a problem with the ASA XML parser.
The memory exhaustion vulnerability affects ASA software releases later than 9.0, and can be exploited remotely.
The software has a bug in how it handles ICMP errors in IPsec packets, and crafted packets sent either through LAN-to-LAN or remote access VPN tunnels can “deplete available memory”.
That results in a denial-of-service, either because the system becomes unstable or it stops forwarding traffic.
The software is vulnerable if the user's using IKEv1 or IKEv2 for LAN-to-LAN VPNs, or remote access VPNs using Layer 2 Tunnelling Protocol and Ipsec; and if the system is validating ICMP errors.
The XML parser vulnerability is less serious, because it can only be exploited by an authenticated user.
A local admin can crash the system by tricking the ASA into parsing a malicious XML file; while someone with Clientless SSL VPN access can send a crafted XML file over their connection.
In either case, because the XML parser isn't sufficiently hardened, the malicious file can force a system reload.
All ASA releases are affected, and Cisco has released patches. ®
