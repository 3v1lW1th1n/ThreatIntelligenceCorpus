The cyber attacks against the Dyn DNS service that affected a huge portion of Internet users in the US is monopolizing the media.
IT security experts have no doubts, hackers powered the massive DDoS attack with a huge botnet composed of IoT devices infected by the Mirai malware.
We are all trying to discover who is behind the attack and which is its motivation. On Friday, while the massive DDoS attack was creating the panic among netizens on the Internet, WikiLeaks invited its supporters to stop the offensive.
Mr. Assange is still alive and WikiLeaks is still publishing. We ask supporters to stop taking down the US internet. You proved your point. pic.twitter.com/XVch196xyL— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) 21 ottobre 2016

Most interesting is the motivation that they provided me. Not only the Assange’s case. They told me that the attack is also a message for the Russian Government.
“If Russia is against the U.S we are against Russia. This is were we draw the line, we are sending a warning message to Russia. “
