BlackBerry goes all 'patch Tuesday' with multi vuln fixes
BlackBerry has issued four patches covering vulnerabilities in Flash, Webkit and libexif on its devices.
The Z10, Q10 and PlayBook all need patching for Adobe Flash vulnerabilities. If a user were led to a page containing crafted Flash content, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on an affected device. BSRT-2013-007 notes that an alternative attack would be to trick users into downloading an Adobe AIR application.
BlackBerry also states that since the Flash player isn't enabled by default on the devices, only phones whose owners have added Flash are vulnerable.
That's not the case for EXIF, whose tag parsing library libexif is also vulnerable to malicious crafted content. If a user viewed an “attack” image, and then tried to open it separately or save it, the attacker could “execute arbitrary code in the context of the application that opens the specially crafted image.”
BlackBerry seems to have been using an old version of the EXIF library, since this notice about the library vulnerabilities is dated July 2012.
Two Webkit vulnerabilities are also patched, one affecting only the Z10, the other also taking in the PlayBook tablet. The company says neither vulnerability is currently being exploited.
In both, BSRT-2013-008 and BSRT-2013-010, malicious JavaScript could offer a remote code execution opportunity.
BlackBerry says its sandboxing should limit the risk to users, should any exploits to these vulnerabilities exist.
BlackBerry 10 OS earlier than version 10.0.10.261 (except versions 10.0.9.2709 and 10.0.9.2743) and BlackBerry PlayBook tablet OS earlier than version 2.1.0.1753 are vulnerable to the BSRT-2013-008 bug. BlackBerry 10 OS earlier than version 10.1.0.1392 is vulnerable to BSRT-2013-010. ®
