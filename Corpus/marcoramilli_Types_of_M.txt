Types of Malicious Hacker


This article from infoworld shows up  7 different types of hackers offering a nice explanation. I like taxonomies and I also use to catalog hackers during my classes, depending on targets technical skills and social background (for example, political, social, religious and so forth). For this particular reason I do like Grimes' taxonomy on the Hacker Differentiation.Roger Grimes' Hacker Taxonomy:Cyber criminalsSpammers and adware spreadersAdvanced persistent threat (APT) agentsCorporate spiesHactivistsCyber warriorsRogue hackersToday I suggest the small reading from infoworld, it provides a clear evidence of what are the differences between malicious hackers helping people to prevent attacks by keeping out systems from their intents.
