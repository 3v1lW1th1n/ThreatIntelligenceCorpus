Security firm Group-IB has detected a new variant of malware that targets the popular Russian stock-trading platform QUIK (Quik Broker, Quik Dealer) provided by Russian software developers ARQA Technologies. The malware has been used during various attacks staring in last November (2012) with the purpose to gather detailed information on the respective owners of the accounts.


As revealed by security experts at Group-IB what is considered “anomalous ” is the interest of attackers in high profile banking accounts, traditionally hackers try to compromise private and corporate banking accounts to steal funds and Corporate accounts represents an ideal, but difficult target, due higher balances.
All were started last year when Group-IB gathered information on numerous incident fraud on popular online trading and stock brokerages.
On the other hand large scale banking fraud schema has exploited the capabilities of popular malware such as Spy Eye and Zeus that keystrokes and extract banking account information from victims.
Fraudsters seem to have changed strategy beginning to use malware developed by black hat coders that developed a strain of malware specialized on QUIK trading platform and FOCUS IVonline from New York-based EGAR Technology.
Both platforms are used by principal banks including Russian Alfa-Bank, Promsvyazbank and Sberbank and both are used for trading on Russian stock exchange MICEX that offers various financial services including placing and trading stocks, listing securities, and even the facility to set up initial public offerings (IPOs) or company flotations.
The malware is a smart agent that once infected the victims verify the presence of the trading software to monitor the victim’s operation capturing screenshots and intercepting credentials which are sent back to the C&C server.
“Some of such data was extracted by elite Group-IB specialists in handling the C&C servers, and then some monitoring by Group-IB Bot-Trek returns victim information.”
Andrey Komarov, the head of international projects at  Andrey Komarov of Group-IB confirmed that the malware use against the trading platforms is a variant of the Ranbyus spyware, a malicious code used against windows users to steal online banking credentials.
“It has quite similar functions to Zeus, as it uses a VNC spawning module which helps the hacker to be connected to the infected PC absolutely remotely and to do fraud silently, that’s why it won’t be detected by anti-fraud filters, as the theft will happen from the same IP address,” Komarov explained.
I directly contacted Andrey Komarov, following an excerpt of our conversation:
Did you face with such kind of threats before? Were the any known incidents on such cases?
Ranbyus spyware is not the only one cyber threat that menaced the “precious” platforms, QUIK has been attacked by the Trojan, Broker-J that instead of spy on user operations steals encryption keys from the application storage and transfers them to attackers.
Vladimir Kurlyandchik, head of business development at ARQA Technologies recommended customers to install defense systems and keep them updated, he also invites the clients to alert the company in case of suspicious activities discovered:
“In case of any suspicions of unauthorized  access to an account the end user should immediately initiate the procedure of changing access keys. It is also our standard recommendation,”
