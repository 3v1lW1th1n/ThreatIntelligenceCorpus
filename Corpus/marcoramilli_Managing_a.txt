Managing and Writing




Today I want to simply share on my diary a great picture of my working day (this picture is a screen capture of a double monitor running a progect in nodejs). This picture represents an amazing security project finally ready to the first public release and ...  the desire of writing "amazing code".





You will never have enough time to write the "perfect code" (whatever definition you are giving to "perfect code"), it doesn't care if you are working on Agile programming, Extreme programming, RAD (Rapid Application Development), waterfall, prototype development or sphiral development the time you have to build your amazing applications will be money driven a so, quite often, you will need to deal with timing issues.

But the great news is that nobody wants you to write the perfect code. What you have to do is to improve your code step-by-step and writing the best code for the time being.
