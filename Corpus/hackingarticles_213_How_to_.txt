How to Permanent Fix 404 Errors in WordPress Site

From Wikipedia
The 404 or Not Found error message is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was requested.
The web site hosting server will typically generate “404 – Not Found” web page, when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link, hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors users can find on the web
Two advantages we get when we are using this method 
Login to your WordPress Dashboard and go to Appearance > Editor.

Click 404 Template (404.php) to open it in Editor Window
Delete all code in 404.php file and enter following lines of code in it: 

   header(“Location:http://www.yourwebsite.com/”);
?>
Hit the Update File Button

If the file does not exist than create 404 Template file or 404.php. If it does replace it with the following code & click save

   header(“Location:http://www.yourwebsite.com/”);
?>
Upload this new 404.php to theme directory. Now when a user hits a 404 page will be redirected to the homepage
Note: “YOURPAGEURL” with your page URL. Make sure you leave the open & close quotes.
