Plaid CTF results


I am so proud about our security group, made by the most talented hacking students in the university of Bologna. CeSeNA ( Cesena Security, Network and Applications ) is the official name of the security team I used to lead, but when those students compete in hacking contests the official name jumps to ANeSeC ! CeSeNA for security and ANeSeC for hacking purposes.The past weekend ANeSeC participated to a quite known hacking contest: the plaid CTF. 720 teams from 82 different countries. We were 42th (and first Italian team) !! Not bad at all considering some "key elements" were not playing !! Good job CeSeNA-ti I am so proud !!Â
