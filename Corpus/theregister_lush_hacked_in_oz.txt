Luckless Lush hammered in hack
Australian cosmetics retailer Lush has pulled the kill-switch on its web store following a security breach.
In a statement that replaced its home page on Tuesday, Lush Australia says it has been alerted that the security breach may have exposed customers' credit card information. The statement directs customers to contact their bank to discuss whether cancellation is warranted.
In spite of the similarity to a similar breach of Lush's security in the UK, the company claims the two incidents are not related.
"Our Website is not linked to the Lush UK Website, which was recently compromised," the company's statement said.
According to a report by the ABC, Lush has since confirmed that card details were stolen, along with the company's entire customer database.
Lush Australasia director Mark Lincoln says customers would not have been aware that their card details were kept. The ABC report says the vulnerability occurred because of a "failure to keep the Website updated".
The company told the ABC it does not know how long breaches may have been occurring. ®
