This module attempts to login to GlassFish instance using username and password combinations indicated by the USER_FILE, PASS_FILE, and USERPASS_FILE options. It will also try to do an authentication bypass against older versions of GlassFish. Note: by default, GlassFish 4.0 requires HTTPS, which means you must set the SSL option to true, and SSLVersion to TLS1. It also needs Secure Admin to access the DAS remotely.

msf auxiliary(glassfish_login) > set rhosts 192.168.1.14
msf auxiliary(glassfish_login) > set rport 4848
msf auxiliary(glassfish_login) > set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
