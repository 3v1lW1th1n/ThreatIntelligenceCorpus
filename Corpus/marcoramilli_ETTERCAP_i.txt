ETTERCAP is still alive




As many of you might know, Ettercap has been one of the most important tools during the past decade. It was one of the most powerful, fast and easy to use "man-in-the-middle" attacks tools. When it reached it first "NG" version during 2004 it was able to automatically decrypt WEP packets, to perform ICMP, DHCP and DNS attacks and it was able to sniff many of the most used protocols grabbing credential, certificates and symmetric encryption keys.




It has been six year since Ettercap developers released the last update. Â But in these days 11-12-04 a new version of Ettercap (0.7.4 - Lazarus) became available. This version fixed a lot of Buffer Overflows bugs and made Ettercap compatible with mac OS X Lion and 64bit architectures.

I think Ettercap developer team is not anymore the same of six year ago, but I totally encourage these new guys to bring it to a new life implementing new features such as HTTPS stripping, WPA 3-handshake sniffing, etc. Keep up the good work guys.
