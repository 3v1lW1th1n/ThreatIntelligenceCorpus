Google Patches 31 Flaws in Chrome
Google has patched a long list of serious security vulnerabilities in Chrome, including at least 19 highly rated flaws. The company patched a total of 31 vulnerabilities in Chrome 34 and paid out more than $28,000 in rewards to researchers who reported bugs to Google.
Among the security fixes in Chrome 34 are patches for a number of use-after-free vulnerabilities in various components of the browser. Google’s internal security team also discovered quite a few of the vulnerabilities patched in the latest release.
In addition to the security patches, Google introduced a change in Chrome 34 that will allow users to save passwords in the browser even if they have the autocomplete feature disabled.
“As we’ve previously discussed, Chrome will now offer to remember and fill password fields in the presence of autocomplete=off. This gives more power to users in spirit of the priority of constituencies, and it encourages the use of the Chrome password manager so users can have more complex passwords. This change does not affect non-password fields,” Daniel Xie of the Chrome team said.
