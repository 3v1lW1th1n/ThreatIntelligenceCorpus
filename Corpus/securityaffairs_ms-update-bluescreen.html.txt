Last Friday, Microsoft urged its users to uninstall the latest security updates issued by the company because they are causing the unpleasant bluescreen, also know as  “Blue Screens of Death” or BSoD.
“Yesterday I ran all the updates of the August patch day. Installation went smoothly. After rebooting everything worked fine. But when I shut down my notebook and switched it on a little later it came up with a blue screen with a Stop 0x50 in Win32k.sys. I could not even boot into safe mode as Windows failed to start no matter which mode chose.” states Xformer.
“Microsoft revised this bulletin to address known issues associated with installation of security update 2982791. Microsoft is investigating behavior associated with the installation of this update, and will update this bulletin when more information becomes available. Microsoft recommends that customers uninstall this update.”
