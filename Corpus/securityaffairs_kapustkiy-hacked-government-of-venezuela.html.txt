					@Kapustkiy is back and hacked the Government of Venezuela					
The White hat hacker Kapustkiy has hacked the Government of Venezuela and leaked data on Pastebin http://pastebin.com/ud0pewGL.
Kapustkiy hacked the website www.gdc.gob.ve by exploiting a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in:
http://www.gdc.gob.ve/2.0/gui_resources/css/?f=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
“I have found a LFI in the Capital website of the Government of Venezuela. And I hacked other two websites by exploiting a SQLi. I found around 800 users in the second website and the third website had 52 accounts.” said Kapustkiy. “I hacked them in protest against the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro.”
The hacker hacked in protest against the President of Venezuela explaining that he is destroying the life of innocent people.
“Hacked By Kapustkiy from New World Hackers. I am against the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro on Venezuela. I am tired of seeing, Nicolas Maduro is still running as president. It is time to leave, you motherfucker.” states the manifesto published on PasteBin.
Kapustkiy is currently working as white hat hacker reporting the flaws, but this time he made an exception for a political motivation.

In December 2016, Kapustkiy hacked the Russian Visa Center in the USA and accessed information of around 3000 individuals.
In the same month, the young hacker hacked the website of the Costa Rica Embassy in China and the breached the Slovak Chamber of Commerce (www.scci.sk) affecting more than 4,000 user records.
In 2016, Kapustkiy targeted several organizations, including the Consular Department of the Embassy of the Russian Federation, the Argentinian Ministry of Industry, the National Assembly of Ecuador, the Venezuela Army, the High Commission of Ghana & Fiji in India, the India Regional Council as well as organizations and embassies across the world.
He also broke into the ‘Dipartimento dellaFunzione Pubblica’ Office of the Italian Government, the Paraguay Embassy of Taiwan (www.embapartwroc.com.tw), and the Indian Embassies in Switzerland, Mali, Romania, Italy, Malawi, and Libya.
