INUNDATOR.


Hey folks,today I wanna point out this interesting tool called inundator.inundator is a multi-threaded, queue-driven, IDS evasion tool. Its purpose is to anonymously flood intrusion detection systems  (specifically Snort) with traffic designed to trigger false positives via a SOCKS proxy in order to obfuscate a real attack. Inundator would be used whenever you feel there is a significant chance the attack you're about to perform may be detected by the target's intrusion detection system. You would launch inundator prior to starting the attack, and continue running it well after you have finished the attack. The hope is that if your attack is detected by the IDS, the alert will be buried among several thousand false positives, thus minimizing the chance of an IDS analyst detecting the real attack.Basically if you wanna hide your payload you know how to do it!Enjoy you new safe "hider" software.
