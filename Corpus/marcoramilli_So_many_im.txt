So many important people in one day ..


Hey folks,during these two days (13 and 14) I've been involved in E2E voting system workshop in Marvin Center @ George Washington University. The workshop was really interesting because there were lots of different  cultures, like for example "University Staff",  "Poll Workers", and "Usability People", that explained the same problems in different point of views.What I liked more were the two "thinking panel" (aka: where the E2E voting science is going...) because well known people like Ron Rivest and David Chaum have given their futuristic vision and, unbelievably, it was clear and well detailed.After the two main panels I spoke for few minutes with them, and I'm extremely grateful to both of them to have participated at our WorkShop.
