MalControl Video




After the big success obtained through MalControl open source software, people asked me to record a simple video to show how it's supposed to work. I did use screencast this time.





This short quick'n dirty video shows how MalControl is supposed working. Please refer to the original GitHub page (https://github.com/marcoramilli/malcontrol) for every needs, tickets, request and so on. If you want to add your scraper and/or new frontend features please email me, every support is welcome.
