Who owns our data? Evgeny Chereshnev talks at TedX Kazan
Our bionic man, Evgeny Chereshnev, had a chance to speak at a TedX event in Kazan. During his 17-minute talk, he discussed what he has learned from having a biochip in his hand.
As any regular reader of this blog knows, he is quite vocal about the use cases of the biochip and the synergy between man and machine. However, one issue he mentioned in the talk is quite the conversation starter: who owns our digital data and memories?
â€¨In the video below, Chereshnev discusses how data has really become part of our DNA and why he believes we need to start looking more into what the future holds for our data.
So, hang on tight and watch the video below with an open mind as we look at the future of our data.
