Shamoon is a type of destructive malware that has been previously associated with attacks against the Saudi Arabian energy sector we've been tracking since 2012.

Additionally, Talos will continue to monitor for new developments to ensure our customers remain protected.


Propagation

Other Mitigation Strategies
Recent Shamoon 2 activity serves as a good reminder that users and organizations need to have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. No one can say for certain if you will be targeted by destructive malware but we can say with 100% certainty that all drives fail. Without a proper system to backup and restore your data, you risk permanently losing your data. Ensuring your assets are properly backed up and can be quickly restored is critical should a system become compromised by Shamoon, ransomware, or other destructive malware and require a complete restoration.
