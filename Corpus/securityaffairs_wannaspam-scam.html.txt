					WannaSpam – Beware messages from WannaCry-Hack-Team, it is the last hoax					
Many users have received a mysterious message from a group that called itself the “WannaCry-Hack-Team” that claims that WannaCry Ransomware has returned.
The mail informs the recipients that their computer has been infected and ask them the payment of a ransom to avoid their files being deleted.

This is a classic spam campaign that leverages the infamous notoriety of the WannaCry ransomware, for this reason, experts tracked it as WannaSpam.
The recipient’s computer is not infected so they only need to ignore the message and delete it.
On Reddit users reported to have received WannaSpam messages, the emails use different subjects to trick victims into pay the ransom.
Some of the subjects used are “!!!Attantion WannaCry!!!”, !!!WannaCry-Team Attantion!!!”, “Attantion WannaCry”, “WannaCry Attantion!”, or “WannaCry-Team Attantion!!!”.
Experts noticed a typo error in the word “Attention” that is reported in the email messages as “Attantion”.
In case the recipients will not pay the ransom, the data will be deleted in 24 hours.
The expert Lawrence Abrams from BleepingComputer that reported the news also published a number of bitcoin addresses used by crooks behind WannaSpam campaign.
