Maryland Tested New Electronic Voting System


From Wired.On Tuesday voters in Takoma Park, Maryland, got to try out a new, transparent voting system that lets voters go online to verify that their ballots got counted in the final tally. The system also lets anyone independently audit election results to verify the votes went to the correct candidates.The open source, optical-scan system, called Scantegrity, was developed by cryptographer David Chaum, with researchers from MIT, the University of Maryland - Baltimore County, George Washington University, the University of Ottawa and the University of Waterloo. Itâ€™s similar to another system, called Punchscan, that won the researchers $10,000 in 2007 at a voting machine competition sponsored by the National Science Foundation.I'm looking forward to see the new logs !
