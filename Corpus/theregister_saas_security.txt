SaaS and Security
Tech Panel The security discussion around Software as a Service (SaaS) is pretty lively. It is common to hear IT professionals question whether service providers can be trusted to look after business data. We are trying to determine how real the risk actually is, and how it compares to risks currently associated with data storage in house.
You can help us. Whether you have experience of SaaS or not doesn’t matter, because we want to compare perceptions with actual experience.
If you’re up for it, then have a crack at our survey. It's pretty comprehensive, because we really want to get under the skin of this thing, so make sure you grab a cuppa before you start.
