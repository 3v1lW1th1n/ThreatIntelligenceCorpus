A huge number of Gmail accounts lockout the users, the strange behavior leads the experts into believing that something has happened. Is it a computer glitch or a hack?

Rumors of a cyber attack are circulating online, on Reddit many users shared a description of their strange experience. Gmail users are receiving messages informing them that their account has been changed, and asking them to re-sign into Gmail accounts on their mobile.
Google replied to one of the thread on one of its official forums by confirming that an investigation is ongoing, but at the same time, the company is downplaying concerns.
In response to a thread on one of its official forums, Google said it was investigating the issue while downplaying concerns confirming that there is no indication the accounts have been hacked.
“We’ve gotten reports about some users being signed out of their accounts, unexpectedly. We’re investigating, but not to worry: there is no indication that this is connected to any phishing or account security threats. Please try to sign-in again at accounts.google.com and if you cannot remember your password, please use this link (g.co/recover) to recover your password.” reads the Google’s response.

Hackread.com cited Crystal Cee from Google’s Product Forum, confirming that Google users need to sign in again to access their accounts using this address “accounts.google.com.”
Cee explained that if users have forgotten the password then they have to use this link “g.co/Recover” to recover it. Cee also added that users with 2-step verification can experience a delay in SMS code reception.
We can only wait for further information shared by the IT giant.
Stay Tuned.
