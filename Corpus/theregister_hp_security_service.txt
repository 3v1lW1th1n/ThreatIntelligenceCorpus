HP launches security service for after the horse has bolted
HP is getting into the lucrative security remediation sector with a consultancy service designed to minimize the effects of a successful attack, collect evidence for prosecution, and help recover what has been stolen or corrupted.
"It's nearly impossible for organizations to prevent a breach, but they can take control of how they respond," said Andrzej Kawalec, CTO of enterprise security services at HP in a statement.
"Combining HP's portfolio of services and software, the HP Breach Management Solution arms clients with the tools and resources to monitor, manage and respond to breaches head on, minimizing their impact while readying for the next attack."
As part of the package, HP is offering a 24/7 multilingual breach-response service that will seek to mitigate the effects of a successful attack. Meanwhile, forensic consultants can advise on the procedures companies need to have in place before an attack, and will pore over the aftereffects and try to collect evidence if the case comes to court.
Naturally, HP is keen to add its ArcLight service to the package, and there's a data recovery squad that can pick over the pieces and try and find any bits that were either lost of corrupted in the attack.
Pricing for the service is on a per-hour basis and companies can pick and choose the components they want. More details will be announced at the HP Discover conference in June. ®
