					Happy birthday, Security Affairs celebrates its Anniversary Today					
It is a dream that comes true, thank your support, I started with a daily single post, today I try to cover the best news almost in real time ;-).
I’m very happy and proud to be here with you for the sixth year. I want to thank you for the support and the interest in the subject. Six years passed away, the cyber security is assuming a crucial role in modern society.
Today it is much easier to speak about cyber security, Information warfare and cybercrime thanks to the work of Security Affairs, and many other media outlets and blogger that do it for passion.
I started for joke saying that “Security is everyone’s responsibility”, this is my idea of cyber security that is becoming the spot of government organizations worldwide.
I’ll continue to spread awareness, it is essential to improve the resilience to cyber attacks on our infrastructure. The information sharing is a pillar of any cyber security strategy, spreading and sharing the information on a cyber threats is possible to mitigate them.
I have many ideas to improve our experience, but the time seems to be not enough 
I really appreciate your suggestions (pierluigi.paganini@securityaffairs.co), I’ll do all the best to make better.
I wish all the best for you and your families
Sincerely, Thank you!
Pierluigi
