An experimental presentation


Yes, I am going to have an experimental presentation in Lausanne, SW during the eGOV 2010 conference. Am I crazy ? Well .... first of all eGOV conferences have been not my field ( SO FAR ! ;) which means nobody knows me, so what a better chance to try with a new presentation concept ? I am bored about the usual "slides" LateX/Beamer presentations, I wanna do something different. Lets try it and see how it goes. I know my prezi presentation is not really good in terms of fashion, images, graphics .. but it is my first one made in less then one day after the need to paradigm change from beamer to prezi. Every comment, suggestion critic is welcome..prezi-player { width: 550px; } .prezi-player-links { text-align: center; }An integrated application of security testing methodologies to e-voting systems on Prezi
