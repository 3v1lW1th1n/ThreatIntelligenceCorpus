Firefox 3.0.6 fixes yet another JavaScript bug
Mozilla has released an update to Firefox 3.0 that fixes half a dozen serious security glitches in the web browser.
The group’s developers, who have been struggling to get the next version of Firefox 3.1 out the door due to problems mainly associated with Mozilla’s new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine, labelled six bug fixes in version 3.0.6 as critical.
It released the update yesterday and confirmed that the worst vulnerability to have been addressed was, once again, a JavaScript issue.
Mozilla said the bug, which also affects its Thunderbird email client and SeaMonkey internet suite, could allow a wrongdoer to run dodgy code on exploited machines.
The Firefox 3.0.6 update also comes loaded with improved scripted commands, including extensions such as Adblock Plus, to work properly with plug-ins, said Mozilla.
As we reported last week, Mozilla’s developers have been struggling to nail a release date for the third beta of Firefox 3.1, following a series of bugs in the browser including problems with its TraceMonkey JavaScript engine.
"At this time, we don't have a good estimate for when we'll be done," Mozilla said on 28 January. “Many of the bugs are proving to be tricky and complicated to fully resolve." ®
