Weekly Phishing Activity: October 3, 2016
Week of September 25 – October 1, 2016

In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >35% increase in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. We saw the biggest change in eCommerce, which saw a >130% increase over last week. Electronic Payment Systems (75%) and Computer Hardware (>45%) also saw increases. Social Networks so the largest decrease in phishing activity, at (>5%).
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
