Security Thoughts


Hi folks,this morning I wanna share some of my "Security thoughts" on "people and security" that I said during the past conference. I've been recorded and now listening to my words I decided to ''better formalize" them in few sentences.People are both the problem and the solution, the disease and the cure. It is a dog biting its tail, an inÔ¨Ånitive loop which will assure that security problems will never end independently from software engineering or security  metrics. Security has been, it is, and it will be a fundamental discipline in  the future of every system.
