Fring cops to unchangeable passwords
Do you use Fring? Do you change your passwords regularly? If you answered yes to both then you're lying, as Fring has admitted that changing the password isn't an option.
Fring is an identity-aggregator which combines instant messaging and VoIP applications, routing connections through its servers to provide an integrated interface. That means Fring has to keep copies of all your messaging passwords, and makes the inability to change the master password even more worrying.
The tip comes from a Reg reader who contacted Fring to ask how to go about changing his password, and was told that it was impossible. He was advised that it could only be done by him asking Fring to delete the account and then create a new one, as passwords are immutable. Like us, he was flabbergasted. The company has now confirmed to us that passwords can't ever be changed.
"Your reader is correct, you cannot change your password on fring, once registered. The way around it is to ask us to delete your account and have you re-create it with a new one," Fring told us.
Register readers, of course, know the importance of regularly changing passwords, so obviously none of you are using Fring.
Fring recently added video support for Skype, allowing free video calls over 3G networks, and featured in our top-10 list of Android apps as it's a very nice application despite the company lacking any kind of believable business model. Obviously not many Fring users have tried to change their password, but knowing that it can't be done doesn't instil confidence in the company's security. ®
