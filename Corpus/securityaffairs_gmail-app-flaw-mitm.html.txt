Google Gmail application for iOS is exposed to risks of  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks which allow bad actors to monitor encrypted email communications.
An expert at mobile security firm Lacoon has discovered that version of Gmail for iOS based mobile device does not perform the certificate pinning procedure when establishing a trusted connection to the service provider, this means that an attacker can view plaintext emails and steal credentials in MitM attack, millions of its Apple device users are exposed to the risk of attack.
“The configuration profile is an extremely sensitive iOS file which allows [them] to re-define system functionality parameters such as device, mobile carrier and network settings. The root CA [certificate authority] is what enables the threat actor to create spoofed certificates of legitimate services,” said Avi Bashan. “It is important to note that the configuration profile is very simple to install. More so, many legitimate enterprise policies demand its installation.“
