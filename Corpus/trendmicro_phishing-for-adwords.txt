Phishing for AdWords
Search Engine Roundtable reports a new round of phishing attacks that target the credit and debit card numbers of Google AdWords customers. This more classic form of phishing, in that a Web form is served up to collect financial information, is different than the AdWords malware fraud reported earlier this month. Donâ€™t be surprised if future variants of these phishing attacks target login credentials so the phishers can take control of the accounts and serve up fraudulent advertisements to lure consumers to bogus Web sites.
