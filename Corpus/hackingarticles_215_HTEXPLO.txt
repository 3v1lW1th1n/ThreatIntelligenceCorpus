HTEXPLOIT – Bypassing htaccess Restrictions

HTExploit (HiperText access Exploit) is an open-source tool written in Python that exploits a weakness in the way that .htaccess files can be configured to protect a web directory with an authentication process. By using this tool anyone would be able to list the contents of a directory protected this way, bypassing the authentication process.
The tool provides modularity, by allowing the tester to fully perform an analysis on the protected website of the following attacks: SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion, Remote File Inclusion and others.
 The main characteristic of this tool is that all of the analyses performed are done inside the protected directory, not from the publicly accessible site.
