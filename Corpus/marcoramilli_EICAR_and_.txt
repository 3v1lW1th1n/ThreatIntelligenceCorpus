EICAR and GTUBE Generator


Hi Folks,today I wanna share a little but interesting (at least to me) mini software for testing ANTI-VIRUS and ANTI-SPAM engines.I called it EICAR-GTUBE-Creator and it's a little utility to create run time EICAR Test Antivirus file and GTUBE anti spam test mail.The EICAR test file (official name: EICAR Standard Anti-Virus Test File) is a file, developed by the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research, to test the response of computer antivirus (AV) programs. The rationale behind it is to allow people, companies, and AV programmers to test their software without having to use a real computer virus that could cause actual damage should the AV not respond correctly. EICAR likens the use of a live virus to test AV software to setting a fire in a trashcan to test a fire alarm, and promotes the EICAR test file as a safe alternative.The GTUBE (Generic Test for Unsolicited Bulk Email) is a 68-byte test string used to test anti-spam solutions, notably those based on SpamAssassin. In SpamAssassin, it carries an antispam score of 1000 by default, which would be sufficient to trigger any installation.The EICAR Anti-Virus test file is great to test your Anti-Virus software, but itâ€™s not easy to handle, because your Anti-Virus software keeps deleting it. For this reason I came out with this utility. Here the main window, by clicking on EICAR button the utility will generate the the EICAR file in the current directory. Your AV should detect it immediately ! This utility can be used also to measure AV performance in detecting this file.Here the GTUBE window. Basically you have to send one email to the testing email box. The utility will automatically add the GTUBE "Infection".Finally the Source code and the executable (JAR, platform independent).Java (platform independent) executable (jar)Java Source Code (built to Netbeans 6.5.1)Enjoy your testing
