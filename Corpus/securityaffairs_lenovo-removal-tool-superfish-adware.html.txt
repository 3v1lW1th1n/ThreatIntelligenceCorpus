“We ordered Superfish preloads to stop and had server connections shut down in January based on user complaints about the experience.  However, we did not know about this potential security vulnerability until yesterday.  Now we are focused on fixing it.”  states an official statement released by Lenovo. “We recognize that this was our miss, and we will do better in the future. Now we are focused on fixing it.”
Graham reverse engineered the malicious software in a debugger (or IDApro), the process allowed him to extract the certificate from the SuperFish adware and cracked the password (“komodia”) that encrypted it. By using the password an attacker can potentially inject malware or spy on a vulnerable Lenovo user sharing the same Wi-Fi network.
“We apologize for causing these concerns among our users – we are learning from this experience and will use it to improve what we do and how we do it in the future,” states Lenovo. “In addition to the manual removal instructions currently available online, we have released an automated tool to help users remove the software and certificate.  That tool is here: http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/superfish_uninstall“
Once again, let me suggest verification of the presence of the Superfish Adware by using the test created by the researcher Filippo Valsorda.
