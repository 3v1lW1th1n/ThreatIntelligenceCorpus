In response to the Snowden’s revelations, members of a terrorist group of Al-Qaeda have started using alternative encryption mechanisms to avoid the adoption of alleged flawed cryptographic algorithms debated in the last months. The Threat Intelligence company, Recorded Future, has published a detailed report to demonstrate that members of Al-Qaeda have adopted new encryption applications for the first time, the firm also linked the event to the Snowden revelations.
“Since 2007, Al-Qaeda’s use of encryption technology has been based on the Mujahideen Secrets platform which has developed to include support for mobile, instant messaging, and Macs.
Following the June 2013 Edward Snowden leaks we observe an increased pace of innovation, specifically new competing jihadist platforms and three (3) major new encryption tools from three (3) different organizations – GIMF, Al-Fajr Technical Committee, and ISIS – within a three to five-month time frame of the leaks.” states the official blog post.
