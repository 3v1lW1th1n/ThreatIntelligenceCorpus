A British channel hosted a rare interview with Snowden in Moscow, the interview was conducted by John Oliver from “John Oliver Tonight.”
Aside from jokes like “Do you miss a hot pocket“, or “Do you miss the state of Florida” the interview got serious enough for Snowden to explain one again that the NSA have huge intercepting capabilities, and that yes, it’s good to have these capabilities to fight “Chinese hackers, but now to use it against the American people.”
To support these claims, Snowden gave an example, saying that the NSA spied on UNICEF, does it justify to spy on UNICEF and other organizations? Which gain exists there?

He also told that inside the NSA, nude pictures are passed along, and it’s not considered a big deal. But as he said:
“they are still collecting everybody’s information”
Snowden also explained that every time people use let’s say Gmail, and an e-mail is sent to someone in America “your mail is kept”, or every time that you keep an e-mail and the backup of the email is moved around the world (without you realizing).
One of the lines that makes more sense for me it’s when Snowden says, that we shouldn’t change our habits of sharing whatever we want to share, just because the government its doing the wrong thing. We shouldn’t sacrifice our values, because of that.
As a last note related to this interview, the Patriot Act, active since September 11, 2001, continues working and is what permits from the US Government to do all these.
