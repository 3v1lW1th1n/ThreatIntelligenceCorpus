Using Vulnerability and Exploit Analysis to Effectively Assess Cyber Threats
By Chris Pace on July 7, 2016
We’re all aware that managing and remediating vulnerabilities is an essential component for effective information security. There’s an ongoing need to identify, classify, remediate, and mitigate vulnerabilities that could compromise your network. 
Effectively assessing the risk from a given vulnerability is critical, as the security impact of remediating a specific vulnerability could be dramatically higher than the average. Thousands of vulnerabilities have been disclosed over recent years, yet only a handful, some quite long in the tooth, are the key enablers of loosely targeted attacks enabled by exploit kits.
The outlook for defense of corporate networks and business applications is much more complex and vulnerabilities affecting web applications and business workstations are urgent issues — especially if mitigation and remediation happens while threat actors are still refining malicious code, or compromising exploit targets in other victim organizations.
Recent Recorded Future research entitled “Turning Criminal Forum Exploit Chatter Into Vulnerability Risk Analysis” highlighted that, “Vulnerability management teams waiting on formal CVE releases or specific remediation guidance from vendors are at a disadvantage.”
Using external threat intelligence and analysis it’s possible to observe the series of gates or milestones through which we would expect a specific vulnerability to advance.
As each gate is passed, the level of risk which we can reasonably expect the vulnerability to eventually pose increases.

Our goal is to enable you to identify, assess, prioritize, and respond to vulnerabilities with speed and confidence.
Recorded Future Vulnerability Cards are the focal point, condensing all the intelligence we’ve gathered on each vulnerability from the open, deep, and dark web into a single view and computing a risk score that’s updated in real time.
You can see the power of vulnerability analysis in this short video:

Rapidly assess risks from known vulnerabilities.
Recorded Future computes vulnerability risk scores and presents evidence with links to sources. Intel on exploitation and malcode is merged with NVD data for quick access to vendor advisories with mitigation and remediation steps. Enrich your security products with Intel Card content via our API integration.
Identify vulnerabilities with a higher risk of being weaponized.
Get specific alerts when vulnerabilities of interest are linked to exploit kits and high-risk malware categories that are relevant to your enterprise. Define dashboards and alerting rules for vulnerabilities affecting products in your tech stack using specific CPE names (vendors, products, versions).
Discover undisclosed or new vulnerabilities and zero-day exploits.
Recorded Future’s programmatic identification of exploit chatter for unknown vulnerabilities helps you improve remediation prioritization based on evidence of increased adversary intent and/or capabilities. See real-world examples in our special analysis report.
