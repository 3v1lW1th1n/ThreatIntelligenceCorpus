Dolphin-EMU for MAC


Dolphin is a great WII emulator but it runs only on Windows machine. So if you got a mac you need to emulate Windows. As you might guess it's pretty hard to play a game emulated twice. For this reason I decided to download the sources and to compile it over mac (Intel). Apparently it seems working :If you get a right masterkey.bin and if you try to run a good .iso a lot of errors come out.  Moreover there is no way to change the configuration plugins to improve (and to run) the visualization. Dolphin still doesn't run over MAC . I will work on it during my netx free days.
