SimplyEmail: Email Recon Tools (Email Footprinting)

What is the simple email recon tool? This tool was based off the work of theHarvester and kind of a port of the functionality. This was just an expansion of what was used to build theHarvester and will incorporate his work but allow users to easily build Modules for the Framework. Which I felt was desperately needed after building my first module for theHarvester.
Open Kali Linux Terminal and type
Git clone https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/SimplyEmail.git

Now type .Setup.sh to install the setup

Now run the following command it will gather all email ids in different sources
./SimplyEmail.py -all -e ignitetechnologies.in

Report will be saved in SimpleEmail Folder.
