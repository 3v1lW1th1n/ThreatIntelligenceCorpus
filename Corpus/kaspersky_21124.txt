Transatlantic Cable podcast, episode 23
In this week’s edition of the Transatlantic Cable podcast, Dave and I keep to our tradition of delivering the news in 20 minutes or less. During our discussion, we discuss Chinese police using facial recognition glasses (think Google Glass meets the Matrix), Ethereum scam via Twitter, iPhone source code on GitHub, and more.
