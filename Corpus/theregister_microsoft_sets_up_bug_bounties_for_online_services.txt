Microsoft sets up bug bounties for online services
Having tasted the fruit of the crowd's tree of knowledge, Microsoft has decided it likes it, and is expanding its bug bounty program to cover a broad range of online services.
In this post at Technet, Redmond lists a bunch of domains that are eligible for the expanded bug bounty, including online Outlook, Office365, Sharepoint, Windows.net, Microsoftoneline.com and Yammer services.
Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), cross-tenant data tampering, insecure direct object references, injection flaws, authentication flaws, server-side code execution, privilege escalation, and security misconfigurations will all be eligible for bounties, the post states.
Don't, however, even think about testing the services for denial-of-service: it's prohibited, along with generating heavy traffic loads, accessing anyone else's data, testing your server-side execution beyond proof-of-concept stage, or firing phishing attacks against Microsoft staff.
There's also a fairly extensive list of submissions that won't be eligible for the bounty. These include:
Microsoft first dipped its toe in the bug-bounty waters in 2013, offering US$100,000 during last year's Black Hat conference in July to let hackers stress-test Windows 8 and IE 11.
The new bug bounty program starts a little more modestly, with the minimum payment set at US$500. ®
