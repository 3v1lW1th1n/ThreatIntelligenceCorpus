Author: Robert McDaniel
 

This week saw more than a 20% increase in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. eCommerce saw the biggest increase (>60%) in phishing activity, followed by Electronic Payment Systems (>50%), and Internet Search & Navigation Services (>35%). We saw a major decrease in phishing activity for Internet Content Providers (>50%). We saw a decrease in Energy & Environmental (>15%), and Internet  Software & Services (>40%), which pushed them off the Top 20 list.


Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
