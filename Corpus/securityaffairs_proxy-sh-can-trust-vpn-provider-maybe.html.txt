“We have decided to install a monitor on our Illinois 1 node so as to locate the hacker. A few hours after we announced this move to our public, the hacker came to us to apologize. We then completely removed the Wireshark installation.”
“If you are the hacker, please stop your activities and leave our network. You are not welcome here. Our heaven is reserved for those who are not harmful to other human beings. If you do not leave, we will find you and report your activities to NGO and press officers. For all others, the heaven is still safe for you, dear ones. We will completely remove Wireshark after 7 days and restart the node so that everything is erased (RAM-switch). All other nodes are left unaffected by these actions. Update: Wireshark has now been removed/wiped.“
So how does the user know if he can trust his provider?
Sincerely user has no choice, he can only trust the answers they provided on privacy issues, I always suggest to carefully read the VPN service you sign up with, despite I’m conscious that there are no privacy guarantees.
I could be useful to promote the constitution for an independent foundation to do regular audits security and privacy issues of VPN providers …would be an important step forward!
