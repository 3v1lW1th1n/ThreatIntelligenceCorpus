GPU Assisted Malware


Hi Folks,today I suggest this reading: "GPU-Assisted Malware" by Giorgio Vasiliadis, Michalis Polychronakis and Sotiris Ioannidis.Abstract:Malware writers constantly seek new methods to obfuscatetheir code so as to evade detection by virus scanners.Two code-armoring techniques that pose significant challengesto existing malicious-code detection and analysissystems are unpacking and run-time polymorphism. In thispaper, we demonstrate how malware can increase its robustnessagainst detection by taking advantage of the ubiquitousGraphics Processing Unit. We have designed andimplemented unpacking and run-time polymorphism for aGPU, and tested them using existing graphics hardware. Wealso discuss how upcoming GPU features can be utilized tobuild even more robust, evasive, and functional malware.The paper is interesting and easy to read. It's a short paper (6 pages) quick and fun.I totally suggest to take a break on your daily readings/writings/works to read it.
