Anonymous hack group plans to out anonymous hate group
Persons using the name and iconography of online activist collective “Anonymous” (PUTNAIOOACA) have threatened to out members of the Ku Klux Klan.
In a Pastebin post PUTNAIOOACA operatives say “we will be revealing about 1000 of your klan member identities.”
The motivation for the campaign appears twofold, with the Pastebin dump suggesting revenge as one aim because “We are not attacking you because of what you believe in as we fight for freedom of speech, We are attacking you because of what you do to our brothers and sisters.”
What did the KKK do to PUTNAIOOACA? The paste says “You messed with our family and now we will mess with yours.”
The second motive appears to be outing Klan members working in the public sector, as the Tweet below from the @Operation_KKK account suggests.
As with all things PUTNAIOOACA-related, one can only assume that the Paste and the Twitter account are run by the same people.
The entities behind both suggest that November will become uncomfortable for 1,000 KKK members. And maybe for the rest of us: PUTNAIOOACA operatives haven't conducted high-profile operations of late. If the group, or folks willing to use its name, are back, at the very least security companies will get to scare us about the deadly risk of hacktivism all over again. ®
