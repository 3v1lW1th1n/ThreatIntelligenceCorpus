Think server vulns are the IT department's problem? Think again
Regardless of the type or size of business you're part of, the way we approach security has changed forever.
Gone are the days that a business can feel safe with its security design model. Attacks have become more sophisticated.
Your organization should no longer be thinking about “if” an attack will happen, but be planning for “when”.
The question is therefore, how this changes the scope of our organizational security strategy.
You need to look at the policies, procedures and tools needed to ensure your response is rapid and correct while also covering the steps that can be taken to start closing security gaps within your organization, and learning why security breaches are inevitable.
Only recently we’ve had two high-profile examples of security attack – Sony and Anthem (the latter is second-largest health insurance provider in the US).
Sony suffered a series of attacks that saw the firm have to take core business systems offline to isolate itself from outside intrusion, although not before Sony suffered an embarrassing loss of data. Unreleased films and confidential emails were leaked to the web, and employee data stolen.
Anthem saw 88.8 million private medical records pilfered from its servers while it's emerged the firm turned down an offer from the US government to audit its computer security.
In both cases, the best response firms could offer employees and customers was free identity protection services as a follow up.
The message here is simple: security needs to part of a combined business and public relations (PR) playbook. The security team within your IT department cannot standalone, and the way information is shared with customers and employees can destroy an organizations’ reputation if not done well.
Rethinking your approach and taking action can help significantly. Here are some strategic guidelines that can be used to protect your organizational employees and customers.
While this might seem like the stuff of the big boys, small and medium-sized companies can look after themselves, too. Here are some recommendations:
Now is the time to take a close look at you protection strategy and to ramp up. Falling short on your overall response, not just on the IT and cyber side, could risk the future success and reputation of your business.
