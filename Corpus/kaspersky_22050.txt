Augmenting third-party solutions
In the digital age, all forms of business are going online. On the one hand, that digital transformation is great, giving rise to many new opportunities, but on the other hand, business is not the only beneficiary. Cybercriminals are positively gleeful at the prospect of new tech innovations.
Overall, digital products and services are evolving along fairly standard lines:
One doesn’t have to look far to find examples. The first mobile apps for online banking were simply browser shells. Their descendants are essentially dedicated security solutions tasked with preventing information leaks. It’s safe to say they didn’t evolve for the fun of it. Now other products tread the same path: Social apps, analytical tools, and even games have to put safety first.
In an ideal world, the third point on the evolutionary list would be deleted, and the second and fourth stages would merge. But that won’t happen on its own; a great many developers have no information security expert on the payroll.
Developing noncore technologies independently is a thankless task at the best of times. First, it costs money. Second, it’s reinventing the wheel. Fortunately, there’s no need to overspend or to reinvent our proverbial wheel. For more than two decades now, one company has been creating not only standalone security solutions, but technologies to protect your products and clients from the very latest cyberthreats. You guessed it — that company is Kaspersky Lab.
We provide our technology partners with software development kits and data feeds about new cyberthreats. Our technologies can be integrated into both software and hardware solutions. Here are the main technologies available for adaptation:
