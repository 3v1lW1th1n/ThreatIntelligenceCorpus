Gootkit banking Trojan jumps the Channel
First documented in mid-2014 [1], the Gootkit banking Trojan appeared to focus solely on customers from several French banks. This JavaScript-based malware combines web-injects (a la Zeus) and a clever persistence technique to create a robust tool for stealing online banking logins and other credentials from users of infected systems. In 2015, Gootkit integrated certain fileless features previously noted in Poweliks [2], and it has also been observed being dropped directly by Angler EK (Fig. 1) or indirectly via Bedep (Fig. 2).

Gootkit has been observed targeting credentials for customers of a range of French financial institutions, including Crédit Mutuel, BNP Paribas, Le Crédit Lyonnais, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale, BTP Banque, and Crédit Coopératif. In March 2015, this distribution expanded to include customers of French and Italian banks through spam campaigns [3] that are still ongoing.
 
Here is an example of an email and accompanying Word doc used to deliver Gootkit to Italian targets in December of 2015.

This expansion continued in late October, as Proofpoint researchers observed Gootkit being dropped by Angler EK through multiple infection paths in Canada. Since 2015-11-26, Gootkit has also been seen dropped in Great Britain via Angler EK at the end of a malvertising infection chain.

Configs from the UK-focused injects (Fig. 6) show that these latest payloads are attempting to capture information from customers of a range of financial institutions that are based or operate in the UK, including Paypal, Santander, Natwest, Ulster Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Barclays.
 
This expanded targeting follows a trend we have observed in recent months, as threat actors seek to reach new victims by shifting their distribution to new regions and verticals. With Gootkit finally crossing the Channel it would not be surprising to see it in other regions in the near future, as well as to see other malware with limited geographic presence (such as Shifu) jump on this trend.
