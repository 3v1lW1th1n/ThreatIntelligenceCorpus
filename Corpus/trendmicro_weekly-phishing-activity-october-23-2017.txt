Weekly Phishing Activity: October 23, 2017

This week, we saw a slight increase in overall phishing activity – just greater than 5% – for the top 20 brands we monitor. The industries that saw the largest increases were Social Networks (>50%), Internet Search & Navigation Services (>50%), and eCommerce (>45%).
Only three industries saw decreases in phishing activity at or lower than 10%: Banking, Computer Hardware, and Electronic Payment Systems.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
