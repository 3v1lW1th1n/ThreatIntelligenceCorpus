The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued warning letters to app developers who have installed a piece of software that can monitor a device’s microphone to listen for audio signals that are embedded in television advertisements. Known as Silverpush, the software is designed to monitor consumers’ television use through the use of “audio beacons” emitted by TVs, which consumers can’t hear but that can be detected by the software. The letter warns developers that if their statements or user interfaces  state or imply that the apps in question are not collecting and transmitting television viewing data when in fact they do, then the app developers could be in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

“A finance executive fell victim to a phishing scam that saw the Los Angeles-based maker of children’s toys wire a cool $3 million to Chinese hackers.
Expertly timed during a period of corporate change, the email hit the inbox of the unnamed executive and requested a new vendor payment in the amount of $3 million to a vendor in China. Mattel, of late, has been in a period of change as new CEO Christopher Sinclair had only officially taken over after Mattel had fired his predecessor — a move that aided the con artists.”
