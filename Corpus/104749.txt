Google Fixes Four High-Risk Flaws in Chrome Before Pwn2Own
Google has fixed several serious security vulnerabilities in Chrome 33, just ahead of the Pwn2Own hacking competition at CanSecWest this week, which surely will reveal several more new bugs in the browser.
The companyâ€™s Chrome browser is always at the top of the target list for contestants in Pwn2Own, which rewards them with cash prizes for demonstrating exploits against previously unknown vulnerabilities in the major browsers. A team from VUPEN, along with individual researchers, are lined up to go after Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Adobe Reader and Flash. Google also runs its own Pwnium contest in parallel with Pwn2Own and offers large rewards for new attacks against Chrome.
Pwn2Own is set to begin Wednesday and run through Thursday at the conference, and on Tuesday Google patched four high-risk flaws in Chrome.
