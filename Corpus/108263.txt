Big Batch of Bugs Fixed in Various Versions of IDA
The makers of the popular IDA disassembly and debugging tool have fixed more than a dozen security vulnerabilities in a variety of versions. Some of the vulnerabilities are a couple of years old, and patches are provided for versions from 6.1 up through 6.6.
IDA is a tool used by malware analysts, security researchers and a variety of others to dig into the innards of binaries and see how they work. It will show the execution paths of binaries and help show hidden and potentially malicious behaviors. The tool also includes a debugger that can step through the code and can run in virtualized environments.
On Friday, the makers of IDA announced a major set of security updates for numerous versions of the product that repair a series of potentially critical flaws. One of the flaws is a vulnerability in the IDA kernel.
“Vulnerability in the kernel triggered by a specially malformed database. The TIL part of the malformed database could be used to trigger the vulnerability,” the IDA advisory says.
That vulnerability was patched in versions 6.5 and 6.6. There’s also a vulnerability in the mach-o loader triggered by a specially crafted input file that’s fixed in IDA 6.4. The oldest vulnerability is a flaw in the WinDbg debugger module that was disclosed in April 2011. There’s also a potential vulnerability in qrealloc() and qrealloc_or_throw() that is fixed in version 6.1.
Here’s the full list of fixes in IDA:
