According to the data breach notification service LeakedSource, millions of user accounts allegedly stolen from the Video-sharing Website Dailymotion. LeakedSource confirmed to have received a database containing 87.6 million accounts belonging to roughly 85 million users having unique email addresses.
The records include usernames, email addresses and more than 18 million of them includes password hashes.
The passwords were protected with the Bcrypt hashing algorithm, with 10 rounds of rekeying. Fortunately, the website used the Bcrypt hashing algorithm which is considered secure and hard to crack.

According to the data breach notification service LeakedSource, hackers have stolen the Dailymotion archive around October 20.
Risks and countermeasures
Bcrypt hashing algorithm gives a reasonable level of security to the users, anyway, I suggest Dailymotion users change their password after the data breach.
The bad news is that all the email contained in the Dailymotion websites could be used by spammers in their campaign, crooks could also use them to target them with targeted phishing campaigns.
In November the company that owns AdultFriendFinder and other adult websites, FriendFinder Networks, has been hacked, data breach exposes 412 million accounts making this the largest 2016 hack. Also in this case LeakedSource obtained the leaked data.
