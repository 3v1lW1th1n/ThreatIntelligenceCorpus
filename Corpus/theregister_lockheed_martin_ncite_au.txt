Lockheed Martin splurges $AU10 million on security lab
Lockheed Martin has added a cyber-security centre in Canberra to an international network of labs that includes facilities in the US and UK.
Its NextGen Cyber Innovation and Technology Centre (NCITE) is now under construction, and will comprise 900 square meters of floor space. Due for its official opening in March 2012, Lockheed Martin says the facility will eventually employ 200 staff.
A “soft launch” this week was held to coincide with the 2011 Military Communications and Information Conference in Canberra.
The company’s CTO for cybersecurity, Curt Aubley, said: "We will be able to conduct offensive and defensive control testing and wildfire work on the Internet. It is a separate network where we can train offensive versus defensive, so we can rapidly learn in a safe and secure environment."
The company says the system will run three private clouds and one public cloud, and will be secure to Australia’s “secret” classification level.
According to Defense News, the company is also stringing together a group of partners to form the “Global Innovation Alliance”, with initial members that include the Australian National University’s Edge team, CA, Dell, Glasswall Solutions, HP, McAfee, Quintessence Labs, Schnieder Electric and Taskey.
The NCITE AU facility is in a new building in the Canberra suburb of Kingston. ®
