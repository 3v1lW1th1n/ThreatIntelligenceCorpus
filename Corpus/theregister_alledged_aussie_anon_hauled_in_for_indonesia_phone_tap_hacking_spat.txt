Alleged Aussie Anon hauled in for Indonesia phone tap hacking spat
A Melbourne man has been charged with instigating an Indonesian-led hack of Australian intelligence websites as an alleged member of the Anonymous collective.
Matthew John Hutchison, 21, faced Melbourne Magistrates Court this week over allegations he convinced Indonesian Anonymous hackers angry over October 2013 revelations that Canberra spied on Jakarta to rip into the websites of ASIO, the Defence Signals Directorate (ASD) and ASIS.
After the Indonesian hackers brought down web properties for Australia private businesses such as Danny's Dry Cleaning in the strikes, Hutchison is alleged to have published a video urging his apparent colleagues to target the government assets and threatening retaliation if they did not “leave innocent bystanders out of it”.
Hutchison's alleged multimedia threats escalated to potential “cyberwar” in a second video.
It is unknown if the allegations suggested Hutchison was linked to the @Op_Australia Twitter account responsible for much of the Anonymous' Australian rhetoric.
Entities using the name and iconography of Anonymous (EUTNAIOA) then claimed to have attacked Indonesian web presences and a social media keyboard bashing frenzy ensured.
Hutchison is charged with federal offences of "urging unknown person to commit an offence of causing an unauthorised impairment of electronic communication to or from a computer”: and faces a committal mention on 8 April. ®
