“Get out of the office — travel, walk around and talk to people, meet customers and partners, get the party started — but then trust folks to do things their way. They know their market, and you can’t be in 100 places at once.” — Eugene Kaspersky
“Fast, unplanned growth can make a business uncontrollable. It can lead to spiraling costs and internal chaos. It’s important to understand that and to keep your company ‘healthy.’ If you go to the forest and pick all the mushrooms you see, then sooner or later your basket will be full. If you sort out the mushrooms and choose only the good ones, you’ll have plenty of space left.” — Alex Moiseev
“Give people the space to make mistakes.” — Claudio Martinelli
