IDA FindCrypt




Finally a great IDA Plugin for Cryptography. Often we'd like to know what kind of cryptographic algorithm has been used in the binary we are analyzing: FindCrypt comes to help us ! The idea behind this Plugin is pretty simple: since almost all cryptographic algorithms use magic constants placed inside the binary, FindCrypt just looks for these constants in the program body.


"This approach will fail if the S-boxes have been altered but in most cases they are untouched (can you admit that you understand all consequences of modifying an S-box, say, in AES?)"


 The plugin supports the following crypto algorithms:




Blowfish
Camellia 
CAST 
CAST256 
CRC32 
DES 
GOST 
HAVAL
MARS 
MD2
MD4 
MD5
PKCS_MD2 (byte sequence used in PKCS envelope) 
PKCS_MD5 (byte sequence used in PKCS envelope)
PKCS_RIPEMD160 (byte sequence used in PKCS envelope)
PKCS_SHA256 (byte sequence used in PKCS envelope) 
PKCS_SHA384 (byte sequence used in PKCS envelope) 
PKCS_SHA512 (byte sequence used in PKCS envelope) 
PKCS_Tiger (byte sequence used in PKCS envelope) 
RawDES 
RC2 
RC5
RC6 
Rijndael 
SAFER 
SHA-1 
SHA-256 
SHA-512 
SHARK 
SKIPJACK 
Square 
Tiger 
Twofish 
WAKE 
Whirlpool 
zlib

The Plugin is very simple to be used just select it from the Plugin menu and it will do its job ending up with the following window:







It will also rename the constant arrays and it will put them in the marked location list. I definitely suggest this great Plugin to everybody who's working in reversing engineering. Good joob Guilfanov ! Download it directly from here.
