Last week the iDict hacking tool has been released by a hacker known as Pr0x13, the expert posted the code of iDict on GitHub explaining that it is very easy to use and exploits a very simple mechanism implemented to protect the iCloud accounts. Below an excerpt from the iDict page.
What is this? A 100% Working iCloud Apple ID Dictionary attack that bypasses Account Lockout restrictions and Secondary Authentication on any account.
What this isn’t: A bypass or fully automated removal
Why? This bug is painfully obvious and was only a matter of time before it was privately used for malicious or nefarious activities, I publicly disclosed it so apple will patch it.

iDict exploits a vulnerability in Apple’s iCloud service and Apple promptly patched it, according to a Tweet from Pr0x13.
@pr0x13 Hey. How long did your iCloud tool last in the wild before Apple patched their servers?

Pr0x13 highlighted that the “bug is painfully obvious and was only a matter of time before it was privately used for malicious or nefarious activities”, for this reason he decided to “publicly [disclose] it so Apple will patch it.”
The iDict tool implements a brute-force attack to guess the iCloud user’s password, by Jan. 2 Apple iCloud accounts were being locked to avoid any abuse from attackers.
The security of the iCloud service has been debated for a long after the Fappening case, an alleged flaw in the popular cloud services was exploited by unknown hackers to steal and disclose naked pictures from the private accounts of many US celebrities.
In response to the inceident, Apple urged its users to adopt also for the iCloud a two-step verification process to prevent unauthorized accessed to the accounts.
