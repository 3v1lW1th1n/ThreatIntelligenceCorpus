Weekly Phishing Report: July 18, 2016
Week of July 10 – July 16, 2016

Compared to last week, two industries, Hospitality and Email Provider, leap back into the top two while Real Estate fell.
In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >10% decrease in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. eCommerce (>25%), Computer Hardware (>20%), and Internet Search and Navigation Services (>15%) saw the biggest decreases in activity. Additionally, Internet and Information Services (>10%) saw the biggest increase in phishing.
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
