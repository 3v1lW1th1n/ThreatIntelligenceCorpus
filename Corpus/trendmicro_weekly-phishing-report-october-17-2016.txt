Weekly Phishing Report: October 17, 2016
Week of October 9 – October 15, 2016
While only two brands in the Internet Search & Navigation Services industry made it on the top 20 list, over 50% of phishing attacks were targeted within that sector.
In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >25% decrease in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. In fact, all of the nine industries on our list saw decreases in phishing activity. eCommerce and Internet Search & Navigation Services both saw >35% decreases, followed by Storage and System Management Software and email Providers, which both saw >25% decreases. Internet and Information Services saw a >20% decrease, and Banking and Computer Hardware both saw >15% decreases. Lastly, Electronic Payment Systems saw a minimal decrease at >0.5%.
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
