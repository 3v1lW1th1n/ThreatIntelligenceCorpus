How effective is your security monitoring?
Workshop Poll For many organisations, the litmus test for IT security effectiveness is whether or not security breaches are reduced as a result. Security monitoring should help, but modern environments are complex and multi-faceted, and it can be difficult to determine how much is down to the tools, and how much is down to other factors such as policy.
In this quick poll, we want to get to the bottom of the effectiveness question, both in terms of monitoring itself, and whether resulting environments are any more or less secure. It's mostly tick-and-bash so grab a virtual pen and it should take no more than five minutes of your time, we'll feed your responses into the mill and have the results back to you in no time!
