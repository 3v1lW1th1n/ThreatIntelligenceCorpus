Kali Linux gives itself a Docker-cut
Penetration testing gurus Offensive Security have made their popular Kali operating system available for Docker-addicted system administrators.
Developer Mati Aharoni acted on a request from a user who asked for a Dockerised image of the Kali penetration testing system platform.
"Last week we received an email from a fellow penetration tester, requesting official Kali Linux Docker images that he could use for his work," Aharoni says.
"The beauty [of Docker] is that Kali is placed in a nice, neat container without polluting your guest filesystem.
"With this in place, you have full access to all the Kali packages on any and all systems that run Docker – which ends up being quite an expansive list."
The hackers bootstrapped a minimal Kali Linux 1.1.0a base under its Docker account providing security bods with access to the platform's top 10 tools.
Kali is a staple for penetration testing as it is a dedicated security platform loaded with offensive hacking tools.
The Docker image brings this capability to admins operating the hugely-popular containerisation system that is geared to simplify server management across Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Kali is also available on various fondleslabs. ®
