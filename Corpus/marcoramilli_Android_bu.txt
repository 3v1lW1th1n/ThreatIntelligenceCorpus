Android bug hunting framework


Hi folks, today I'd like to share a very promising framework called Mercury. Mercury is a free framework for bug hunters to find vulnerabilities, write proof-of-concept exploits and play in Android. Use dynamic analysis on Android applications and devices for quicker security assessments. Share publicly known methods of exploitation on Android and proof-of-concept exploits for applications and devices. The easy extensions interface allows users to write custom modules and exploits for Mercury Replace custom applications and scripts that perform single tasks with a framework that provides many tools.To know more about it here, and here (documentation). Actually I am not an android security expert, so far I have never been involved in some security related android projects, but from what is my knowledge about security trends and little bit of security history I would bet on it, it seemed very promising and user friendly! Great job guys, keep going on it !
