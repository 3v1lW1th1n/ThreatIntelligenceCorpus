Google crushes five bad bugs with patch run and $20k in bounties
Google has slung patches at vulnerabilities in its Chrome browser for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
The patches repair five known security holes found and reported by external researchers.
Google paid US$20,337 (£17,875, A$27,789) in bug bounties to researchers who reported the bugs.
Software quality assurance engineer Krishna Govind says the latest stable channel update to version 50.0.2661.102 .
"We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel," Govind says.
Govind says it finds many bugs through tools AddressSanitiser, MemorySanitiser, Control Flow Integrity, and LibFuzzer.
The fixes follow patch runs at Adobe and Microsoft, including an emergency update to close a zero-day Flash hole that is being exploited by attackers. ®
