OurMine first attempted to warn Vevo of the data breach privately, unfortunately for the company, one of its employees responded,
“F*** off, you don’t have anything,” it went public with the data breach and leaked Vevo files.
and in response, the hacker group leaked the precious files.
OurMine shared the following motivation about the hack.
“We leaked it because yesterday we’ve talked with an employee from VEVO about the leak, and that’s what he said:” 

According to Gizmodo, that first reported the data breach, the “majority of the [leaked] files seemed pretty mild—weekly music charts, pre-planned social media content, and various details about the artists under the record companies’ management,” albeit a few documents contained sensitive materials.
Variety, who analyzed the stolen documents, reported that the leaked archive included notes on around 90 artists.
“The 3.12-terabyte trove of stolen documents included Vevo’s internal dossiers on about 9o artists, including Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, Calvin Harris, Florida Georgia Line, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Madonna, One Direction, Sia, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, and U2.”  states Variety.
