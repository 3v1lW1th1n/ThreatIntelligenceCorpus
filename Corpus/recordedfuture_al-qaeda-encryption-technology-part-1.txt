How Al-Qaeda Uses Encryption Post-Snowden (Part 1)

Update: We recently released part two of this analysis. You can find it here.
Al-Qaeda (AQ) has been using encryption technology in various forms for a long time. The original Mujahideen Secrets is the most common one, but recently we’ve seen multiple new encryption products as well as adaptations to new platforms like mobile, instant messaging, and Mac.
The nature of these new crypto products indicates strategy to overlay stronger and broader encryption on Western (mainly US) consumer communication services. We do not find evidence of abandonment of US-based consumer communication services. Likely risks are still greater to hide outside the consumer crowd, and non-US-based services may be exposed to even stronger lawful intercept.
In this analysis using web intelligence (i.e. OSINT), we will explore AQ use of encryption and platforms – as well as explore product developments following former NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s disclosures.
The Recorded Future timeline below lays out key developments from 2007 until now.
Below: The blue line in the middle of 2013 shows the approximate cut-off pre-/post-Snowden disclosures.

Let’s go back to the question of impact regarding the Edward Snowden disclosures. Did his massive release of secret documents lead to a change in communication behavior of terrorists, and maybe others?

This analysis is only looking at a very small sliver of this, but the timeline above tells a compelling story showing how four to five months after the Snowden disclosures both mainstream AQ, as well as the break-off group ISIS, launches three new encryption tools.
For additional analysis on this subject, be sure to read the research completed by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).
