Security execs must prep for post-Brexit cyber challenges – report
Chief information security officers (CISOs) must prepare for the ending of intel and law enforcement agreements with the EU post-Brexit, a report from Forrester has warned.
The key concern for CISOs is the future cooperation on cyber security, said the report. Current arrangements will continue until the end of the transition, and a new security treaty will need to be effective on January 1, 2021.
It went on to outline three specific issues at stake because of Brexit.
CISOs consequently need to bang the drum on these issues and get policy makers listening.
"First, assess what you currently gain from intelligence sharing and security cooperation efforts, then explain their value to lawmakers. In the UK, you can submit for consultations to the stakeholder engagement capability within the Department for Exiting the European Union," advised the report.
Meanwhile it cautioned on diversifying intelligence sources. "In addition to government feeds (eg, threat intelligence from National CERTs) you can collect open source feeds using manual methods, aggregation software available for free on GitHub, or a commercial product."
On GDPR and NIS directives the advice was, unsurprisingly, to keep calm and carry on. ®
