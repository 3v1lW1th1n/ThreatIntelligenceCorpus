Stanford On iPhone


Often university's courses are focalized on theory and most of the time they don't show practical things blaming time . Stanford University understood that practice is  important as much as theory and comes out with an iPhone developer class.I think this is a great idea, iPhone is one of the most important devices of these years, maybe of this decade, most companies know iPhone and most companies are looking for a good developer. Offering the possibility to learn useful practical skills in a university class, seems to be a really smart idea. Here the class link. Here slides and all utilities.
