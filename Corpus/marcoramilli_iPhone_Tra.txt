iPhone Tracker


Hi Folks,during these past days many posts on the iPhone "discovery" (geo-location recording) has been discussed. I think this is important and for this reason I want keeping track of it.  iPhone keeps record of everywhere you go it's the main article on the topic, where you can find links and directions for further researches.  In few words security researchers have discovered that Apple's iPhone keeps track of where you go – and saves every detail of it to a secret file on the device which is then copied to the owner's computer when the two are synchronised. The file contains the latitude and longitude of the phone's recorded coordinates along with a timestamp, meaning that anyone who stole the phone or the computer could discover details about the owner's movements using a simple program.A little portion of Map within iPhone tracksIs Apple storing this information elsewhere?There’s no evidence that it’s being transmitted beyond your device and any machines you sync it with.Where are the problems ?The most immediate problem is that this data is stored in an easily-readable form on your machine. Any other program you run or user with access to your machine can look through it.The more fundamental problem is that Apple are collecting this information at all. Cell-phone providers collect similar data almost inevitably as part of their operations, but it’s kept behind their firewall. It normally requires a court order to gain access to it, whereas this is available to anyone who can get their hands on your phone or computer.By passively logging your location without your permission, Apple have made it possible for anyone from a jealous spouse to a private investigator to get a detailed picture of your movements.Again, Here the application. Have fun.
