Weekly Phishing Activity: September 13, 2017
This week, we saw a >50% decrease in overall phishing activity from the top 20 brands we monitor. Four industries saw a greater than 70% decreases in phishing activity: Computer Hardware, Electronic Payment Systems, Storage and System Management Software, and Social Networks.
Additionally, only two industries saw substantial increases in phishing activity. These included eCommerce at >145% and Telecommunications at >60%.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
