Still Working On RoboAdmin GUI


Hey folks,this will be a  review and RA week, not really more ( well... :P  ). I have several papers to review for 3 different  IEEE conferences, I am going to spend all my week doing reviews. Probably next week we' ll come out with another version of RA (http://roboadmin.sourcefoge.net), with a nice Graphic User Interface to manage all the meeting points like Skype, IRC, MSN ecc... During last mouths I received some emails regarding the in-usability of RoboAdmin and, you guys were right, RA is a very complicate tool. Is a really good idea to manage your secret server, but still very complicated to setup. I hope the new Graphic user interface will help you to use and to spread it. We're always looking for beta-testers.
