Trump carded again: Hotel security aced
Prez hopeful Donald Trump is probably on the phone right now asking Bill Gates how to close down the Internet, following another breach of security in his hotel chain's credit card systems.
If the latest KrebsOnSecurity report is accurate, it would be the second breach of the presidential candidate's hotel chain systems in less than a year.
First reported in July 2015, the breach of Trump Hotel Collection systems wasn't confirmed until September, when the company's lawyers sent a letter to California's Office of the Attorney-General.
According to Krebs, the chain's only response to date is to say that it's undertaking the usual "thorough investigation" of the report.
It seems the breach is emerging the same way as it did in last year's breach, with banks seeing a "pattern of fraud" on customer credit cards that point at the Trump Hotel Collection organization.
Hotels identified in the report are in New York, Honolulu, and Toronto. ®
