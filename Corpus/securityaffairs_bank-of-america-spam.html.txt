Bank of America is being targeted by a new malicious campaign, cybercriminals are spreading a stealthy malicious financial malware to hit the clients of the financial institution.
Security experts at AppRiver recently detected and blocked a set of virus campaigns that use new and novel tactics designed specifically to beat filtering engines. A common factor of the wave of attacks based on these set of malware is the enormous volumes of traffic being sent to data centers. Analysts at AppRiver revealed that the overall volume of traffic was three times than normal .
The malware campaign was arranged by crooks to spread a banking trojan, dubbed Bredo virus, specifically crafted to target the customers of the Bank of America.
Bredo virus, as many other similar malicious code, includes data stealing capability and also a key-stroking features.
The malware could be used also as downloader because it can also download other malicious payload on the compromised machine.
“The software may also have abilities to further infect a system by downloading more malware on to the machine. “
Lesson learned… malware never die.
