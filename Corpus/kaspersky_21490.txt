#TheSAS2018 Day 1 Recap
In today’s podcast, I sit down with members of Kaspersky Lab’s GReAT team from Latin America to recap the first day of the 2018 edition of the SAS. During our chat, Thiago Marques, Santiago Pontiroli and I discuss the following topics:
Matt Tait’s opening keynote. More commonly known as @pwnallthethings on Twitter, Matt took to the stage to discuss the non-new phenomenon that is disinformation. The session set the stage for a day that went all in on False Flags and making the other side miss.
10 years of GReAT. This session was hosted by Costin Raiu and Vitaly Kamluk discussed the evolution of the team as well as what is next for attribution.
From there, we discuss the Olympic Destroyer malware and the prominence of false flags. The guys also offer their takes on what made the malware so interesting.
