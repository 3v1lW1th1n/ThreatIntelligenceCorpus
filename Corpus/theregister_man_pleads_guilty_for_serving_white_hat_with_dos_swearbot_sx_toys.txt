Man pleads guilty for serving white hat with DoS, swearbot, sex toys
Oklahoma man Benjamin Earnest Nichols faces up to 10 years jail in a United States federal prison and a US$250,000 fine after pleading guilty to launching a distributed denial of service attack against security consultancy mccrewsecurity.com.
Nichols, 37, pled guilty to one count of causing the transmission of a program or code to a protected computer launched around March 2010.
Prosecutors estimated the attacks inflicted damages of between US$5000 and $US6500 .
Nichols, alleged to be part of the hacking group calling itself the Electronic Tribulation Army (ETA), played a part in launching the distributed denial of service attack after a post on mcgrawsecurity.com detailing the guilty plea entered by alleged former group leader Jesse McGraw.
The consultancy had assisted the FBI with an investigation to McGraw's hack of a medical centre for which he was sentenced to nine years prison in March 2011. The offending post said that first conviction may "put other script-kiddie type hackers on notice that they can be tracked down and prosecuted".
Script kiddie is a disparaging term for low skilled hackers.
A US Department of Justice statement says "... Nichols got angry at RWM for posting what he considered to be false and disparaging remarks on the blog [and] then used various means to harass and mock RWM, including setting up a derogatory website for RWM, posting disparaging photo-shopped photographs of RWM, and ordering sex toys to be sent to RWM’s home."
The Department did not reveal the identity of RWM.
"In addition, Nichols also created and repurposed a bot that used computer code to respond to certain keywords by transmitting random insults and profanity to RWM’s internet relay chat channel."
A sentencing date was not set. ®
