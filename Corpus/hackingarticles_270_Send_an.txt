Send and Receive Self Destructing mail

KickNotes is a completely free service used to send and receive self-destructing online messages.
Using KickNotes, you can (for example) compose a message which will delete itself after the first time it’s viewed. You can also compose a message which will delete itself after ten minutes but can be viewed an unlimited number of times within those ten minutes. You can even compose a message which self destructs after ten views or ten minutes (whichever comes first). With KickNotes, you’re in control of your messages!
