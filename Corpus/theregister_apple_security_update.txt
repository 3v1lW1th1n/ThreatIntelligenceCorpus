Apple accused of hushing up security update
Apple has been accused of secretly adding a security update to its operating system without telling users, or anyone else.
The update released last week included protection against a Trojan that could allow a hacker to take control of your machine. The HellRTS Trojan has been added to the Mac's list of signatures used to detect dodgy software, according to Sophos' ubiquitous Graham Cluley.
Malware purveyors do not target Macs as much as PCs, which are more tempting because there are more of them.
Cluley claims that Mac users too often ignore security, "And that isn't helped when Apple issues an anti-malware security update like this by stealth, rather than informing the public what it has done. You have to wonder whether their keeping quiet about an anti-malware security update like this was for marketing reasons. 'Shh! Don't tell folks that we have to protect against malware on Mac OS X!'"
Cluley admits there is far less malware around for Macs but warns that continuing to ignore the potential problem could itself encourage hackers to start targeting the operating system.
He said that overall he welcomes any move to improve security but still thinks people should buy anti-virus software too. His company, Sophos, does of course sell Mac and Windows products...
Apple declined to comment, beyond providing this link to the upgrade. ®
