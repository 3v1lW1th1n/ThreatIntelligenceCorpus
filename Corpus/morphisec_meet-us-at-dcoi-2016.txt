Join Morphisec at DCOI 2016 – the Defensive Cyberspace Operations and Intelligence conference – to be held in Washington D.C. May 18-19. This annual high-level US-Israel cyber security summit aims to enhance international cooperation and promote “extraordinary developments in the technological, intelligence and policy-making domains of cyberspace.”

A collaboration of Israel security and governmental agencies and the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), together with companies and corporations across the United-States and Israel, the conference is free of charge for registrants. This year’s keynote address will be given by Admiral Michael S. Rogers, Commander, U.S. Cyber Command and Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service. Other speakers include senior Israeli and American government officials and cyber experts – Morphisec’s very own Omri Dotan is presenting at the Technology Innovation in Cyber Security session.
To schedule a personal meeting during the conference, email or call us at 617-209-2552 or simply stop by our booth. See what the Morphisec hype is about and why Moving Target Defense technology makes us unlike any other endpoint security solution out there.
