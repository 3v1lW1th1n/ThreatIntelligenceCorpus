Weekly Phishing Activity: January 8, 2018

 
This week, we saw a large increase in overall phishing activity – 40% – for the top 20 brands we monitor. With the largest increase in activity being from Telecommunications and the largest decrease being from eCommerce. Only four industries saw an increase in phishing this week.
 
 
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
