					Emails among dumps published by Wikileaks includes 300+ malware					
WikiLeaks has published more than 300 pieces of malicious code among its caches of dumped emails. Dr Vesselin Bontchev (@bontchev), a top Bulgarian malware researcher, has analyzed documents published by the organization and detected 324 instances of malware in its archive of dumped emails.
A check to the instance of malware allowed the malware expert to discover that the almost any instance appears to be an attachment of the dumped email.
The malicious codes are recognized by the Virus Total malware and URL online scanning service, they were likely sent by attackers to the recipients in the attempt to hack them.
“The following table contains the confirmed malware residing on the Wikileaks site. The list is by no means exhaustive; I am just starting with the analysis. But what is listed below is definitely malware; no doubts about it.” wrote Dr Bontchev on GitHub.
“The first column contains a link to the e-mail on the Wikileaks site that contains the malicious attachment. The e-mail itself is safe to view (although the text is usually spam/scam/phish/whatever).”

The situation may be worse because the piece of malware found by the Bulgarian researchers were identified in an initial search effort.
If you want to test the malware adopt all the necessary countermeasures to avoid infecting your machine.
Fortunately, the piece of malware are well known to the principal antivirus solutions, according to the malware researcher, the majority of the malicious codes have a Virus Total detection rate from 80 to 100 percent.
Anyway … be careful managing email attachments from Wikileaks archives.
