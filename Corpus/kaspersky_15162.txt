Forrester names Kaspersky Lab a leader in endpoint security
Today we are pleased to share the results of Forrester Research’s Wave assessment, which places Kaspersky Lab in the highest tier — the Leaders tier — of endpoint security vendors.
The Forrester Wave is a 25-criteria evaluation of 15 prequalified endpoint security suite providers.  It incorporates an evaluation of products’ capabilities — which is typical of any product evaluation — but adds analysis of strategy and market presence based on interviews with vendors and their customers and partners. It is widely recognized as an influential resource for organizations evaluating IT products and services.
Forrester’s independent expert analysis of the endpoint security market indicates that this market continues to be a competitive battlefield. Endpoint security is a growing field because more security professionals see endpoint security suites as a means to address their top challenges. As well, security pros increasingly trust and rely on providers to advise them on security decisions.

As readers of this blog no doubt know, traditional approaches to endpoint security are nowhere near sufficient to secure users in the ever-evolving threat landscape. Therefore, threat detection accuracy and automatic containment measures are key competitive differentiators.
