Another week is starting and this morning the topic that I’ve found everywhere is Internet of Things (IoT), it is a growing paradigm that will influence our life in the next future, and probably it is already doing it. The Internet of Things, as explained in a previous post, refers all objects in daily life equipped with identifiers that allow their automatic inventory. Tagging of the Internet of Things could be achieved with various technologies such as the RFID, NFC, digital watermarking, QR code and muck more.
Unfortunately the rapid diffusion of the The Internet of Things technology is not accompanied by a rapid improvement of efficient security solutions for those “smart objects”.
Cybercrime is aware of the delay in securing The Internet of Things and it is expected an explosion of cyber attacks against a technology still helpless. The Internet of Things is a business opportunity for security firms and a great invention for every industry, everyone could benefit from their adoption, but we must carefully evaluate the cyber threats and the level of exposure of data managed by such useful devices.

Which are principal cyber threats that threaten The Internet of Things? I’ve found an interesting post by Symantec that identified the following potential risks
The post avoided to consider device hacking, it could not be ignored the possible hack of these devices to turn them to unplanned use security experts believe that in the next future hackers will exploit new attack vectors from unexpected directions.
It is likely that attackers will migrate consolidated techniques of attack to The Internet of Things, Symantec experts according the post has no doubts
“We will no doubt see new variations on themes such as ‘man in the middle’ or ‘watering hole’ attacks, this time targeted at information flows from physical objects rather than people and their computers.”
