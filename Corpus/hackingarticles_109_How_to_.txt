XAMPP is the most popular PHP development environment. XAMPP is a completely free, easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP and Perl. The XAMPP open source package has been set up to be incredibly easy to install and to use.
Download XAMPP from here:
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
To install XAMPP, run the XAMPP setup and follow the on screen commands


Allow access to XAMPP in windows firewall

Now, start the XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL services. If the Apache is not being started, then that is because the given ports 80 and/or 443 are not free. To change Apache ports, go to ‘Config’ button (next to admin button in control panel.)  And change the 1st and 2nd files.
In the first file, change all 80 with 81, and in the second file, change all 443 with 444.

Now, go to the installed XAMPP directory and paste the ownCloud server folder in installed directory/htdocs.
Usually the installed directory is: C:\xampp\htdocs
About ownCloud:
OwnCloud is a self-hosted file sync and share server. It provides access to your data through a web interface, sync clients or WebDAV while providing a platform to view, sync and share across devices easily — all under your control. ownCloud’s open architecture is extensible via a simple but powerful API for applications and plug-in and it works with any storage.
Download ownCloud server and client software both from here

Now, open your web browser and type:
localhost:81/ownCloud (assuming the name of the server is ownCloud)
Type in your admin username and admin password then. Do remember this name and password.

A popup will then appear which will tell you that ownCloud clients are available for different mobile phones platform; you might want to check that out as well.

On the right hand side top you will see your admin name, click on that and a popup will fall having many options. Click on ‘users’.

You can see a bar on the top of the page, you ought to input your client ID and password. This client ID and password is the key to your cloud files for the client. So, the client will access the files you share with them in the next step with their ID and password that you give them. No one else but admin (that is you) can see all the clients. All you have to do is give your client their ID and password, and they are ready to use ownCloud.
Type in the details and click create.

Now once the client is created, go to home page again and click on the upload button.

Choose a file to upload. I choose a text file and in the same row as your uploaded file there will be an option to share the file on cloud. Choose that option and fill in the name of client with which you want to share your file. I input the name of client as Hacking Articles.

Now, on the client PC, install the ownCloud Desktop client software.

Input the IP address of the server followed by the port and directory.
In my case, the ownCloud client types:
https://192.168.0.102:81/ownCloud

Now, the client inputs his/her username and password and connects to the server.


Then, click on open ownCloud.

The client inputs his username and password again.

In the activity bar, he/she can see the file shared by the admin.
