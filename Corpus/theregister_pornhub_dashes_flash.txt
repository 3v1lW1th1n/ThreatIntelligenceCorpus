Top smut site stops Flashing, adopts HTML5
Security sentient smut site Pornhub has decommissioned Flash and will swap to HTML5 in a bid to modernise and protect its estimated 60 million daily visitors.
The site is famed for among other things offering a bug bounty to researchers who disclose security holes in the site upping payments and hiring staff to better compete with industry standards.
Pornhub will now switch to the new industry standard HTML5 which sports better load times, power consumption, and avoids the battery of vulnerabilities that make Adobe Flash one of the exploit kit market's favourite p0wn platforms.
The porn broker announced the switch on its dedicated subreddit.
Pornhub's part of a colossal web conglomerate called MindGeek that operates several other adult sites, runs an affiliate marketing network, has over 1,000 people on the payroll and millions of paying customers. It's not difficult to see why an organisation of that scale would be keen to drop a buggy, proprietary plugin and instead adopt a standard.
The change comes after Adobe plugged a whopping 36 vulnerabilities in Flash including one exploited in the wild.
The smut-streamer's decision brings the site in line with browsers such as Chrome and Firefox which have moved to sound the death knell of Flash. Most online assets support both HTML5 and Flash while the latter is decommissioned.
Firefox users will have Flash blocked unless they upgrade to the latest version of the browser. ®
