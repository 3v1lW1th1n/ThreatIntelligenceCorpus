					Hitler ransomware just deletes files instead encrypt them					
Ransomware is one of the most dreaded threats for Internet users and a profitable business for crooks. In the last months, we have seen a number of malware belonging to this category, one of the most recent is a Hitler-themed ransomware that doesn’t encrypt files, but simply deletes them.

In reality, the threat appears to be a work in progress project developed by coders without specific skills.
The Windows ransomware displays a lock screen featuring Hitler, together with a message that warns users that files have been encrypted.
The ransomware requests the payment of only 25 euros, in the form of a Vodafone cash card. It is unusual for such kind of crimes.
The lock screen features a misspelling “Ransonware.”
The website Bleeping Computer published a detailed analysis of the Hitler ransomware that was first spotted by the malware analyst Jakub Kroustek from AVG.
