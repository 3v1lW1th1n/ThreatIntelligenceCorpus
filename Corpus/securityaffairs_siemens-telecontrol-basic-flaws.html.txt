The system is used in water treatment facilities, traffic monitoring systems, and energy distribution plants. The TeleControl Basic control center runs the TeleControl Server Basic software. The Siemens TeleControl Basic system allows organizations to monitor and control processes in industrial environment and operation of municipal facilities.
