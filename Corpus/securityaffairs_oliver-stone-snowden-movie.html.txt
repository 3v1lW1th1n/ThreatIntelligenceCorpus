					Watch the trailer for the Oliver Stone’ ‘Snowden’ movie					
This week I saw the trailer for new the Oliver Stone’s film on the Snowden‘s Story. Oliver Stone is one of my favorite filmmakers, it is the author of jewels like Scarface, JFK,  and Platoon.

His last opera focus on the story of the popular whistleblower that revealed to the world the US surveillance machine.
The film is the film adaptation of book “Snowden, the inside story of the world’s most wanted man”published by the Guardian journalist Luke Harding.
The movie ‘‘Snowden’’ will be released on September 16th, 2016, but I desire to share with you the trailer which is very intriguing.  Give a look at the scene of the Snowden’s Rubik’s Speed Cube.
The scene showed Edward walking along with a Rubik’s Speed Cube, he removed the black rectangles on the sides of the center tile, then he used the cube to exfiltrate the data and bypass security measures adopted by the NSA. A curiosity, Snowden used a Rubik’s Cube to identify himself to Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald.
Enjoy the trailer of the Snowden movie.
