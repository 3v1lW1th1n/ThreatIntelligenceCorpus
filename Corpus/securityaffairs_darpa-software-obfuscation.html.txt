DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) and a team of researchers are turning towards new methods to overcome reverse engineering by using obfuscation to secure government and business security.
The Research Team, remodeling a safe-ware program is believing to develop new mediums reinforce with encryption, further development to conceal software code testable for secure protection of the intellectual property.
Safe-Ware first plans canvassed as obfuscation program last fall, but only recently it officially got underway.
Kurt Rohloff, an Associate Professor of Computer at NJIT (New Jersey Institute of Technology) who leads the team explained to the Signal Magazine that its was inspired by the new challenge.
“I have a peculiar fascination in supporting defense-relevant application,but problem that we’re facing this instance is to have a striking new theoretical innovation and there hasn’t been any hard or critical effort to get it work practically,” Rohloff told the magazine.

Rohloff explained that among the goals of SafeWare there is the development of an “open-source library for lattice crypto technology.”
Claiming that current obfuscation program shortfall on what he calls “quantifiable security models”, the Dr. Michael Hsieh, a program manager at DARPA’s Information Innovation Office that oversees Safe-Ware, hopes that project can distance itself from the “Security through Obscurity.” Hsieh hopes the researchers were able to find a balance between something determinable and challenging for an attacker to “De-obfuscate.”

“If successful, SafeWare technologies will provide provably-secure protection of sensitive intellectual property and algorithmic information in software that is vulnerable to capture and dissection,” wrote Hsieh on the project’s website.
