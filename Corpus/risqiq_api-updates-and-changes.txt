API Updates and Changes

Earlier this week, we released a brand new version of PassiveTotal, complete with new API calls and documents. Our first attempt at an API left much to be desired and didn’t keep up with the feature set that was present within our website. The new version of the API includes the core components of the website, and over the next few weeks, we will continue to grow it to support more account-based actions.
In creating the new API we had two choices, expand on the old code or develop something from scratch. In the end, we decided to develop from scratch to avoid copying of unnecessary code. To avoid breaking the integrations and libraries others have made, we also decided to back-port the old API to the new system. We will continue to support this API until July 1st, 2015.
If you are interested in writing code against the PassiveTotal API, there are two spots to check out. The first is our new documentation which includes code samples, response samples and clear outlines of whats required to perform the call. The next place is our Github repository where we will track tools and libraries developed by us and the community.
As you explore our new API and web interface, we’d love to get your feedback or pull requests. Additionally, if you need assistance integrating our API into a product or tool, please feel free to contact us at info@passivetotal.org.
