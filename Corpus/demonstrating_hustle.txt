Demonstrating Hustle, Chinese APT Groups Quickly U...

Demonstrating Hustle, Chinese APT Groups Quickly Use Zero-Day
Vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) Following Hacking Team Leak
As of publication, we have no reason to believe APT3 and APT18 are
  working together. Their opportunism demonstrates each group’s
  flexibility, organization, and awareness of developments in the
  information security community.
APT3’s Campaign

APT3 actors targeted at least 10 organizations in the following industries:
 Aerospace and Defense Construction and
  Engineering Energy High Tech
Non-Profit Telecommunications
Transportation 
Aerospace and Defense
Construction and
  Engineering
Energy
High Tech
Non-Profit
Telecommunications
Transportation
 An example of an APT3 phishing email is below in Figure 1:
        FROM: "<first.last>" <first.last>@perrydale.com
        SUBJECT:  <Target> Analysis report- 2015
        URLs:
        hxxp://report.perrydale[.]com/ema/RR201507[.]pdf
        hxxp://vic.perrydale[.]com/logo2.jpg
        hxxp://rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/rep201507101[.]pdf
        Figure 1: An example of APT3 phishing email using CVE-2015-5119
As of July 8, all three domains observed in the URLs resolved to
  194.44.130.179. Similar to APT3’s activity in Operation
    Clandestine Wolf, the URLs redirect to JavaScript profilers and
  a malicious Adobe Flash file. The Flash file downloads an obfuscated
  GIF, which contains a SHOTPUT payload compiled the day APT3 sent the
  phishing emails. SHOTPUT is a DLL backdoor that that communicates over
  HTTP and may be capable of uploading or downloading files, managing
  processes, executing system commands, and collecting system
  information. SHOTPUT may also be detected as
  Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter. The SHOTPUT backdoor communicates to the
  following command and control (CnC) addresses, which are hardcoded
  into the malware:
 psa.perrydale[.]com link.angellroofing[.]com
107.20.255.57 23.99.20.198 
psa.perrydale[.]com
link.angellroofing[.]com
107.20.255.57
23.99.20.198
This is the third time since mid-2014 that we have observed APT3
  using a zero-day, which attests to its ability to capitalize on new exploits.
APT18’s Campaign

APT18 actors targeted at least 13 organizations in the
  following industries:
 Aerospace and Defense Construction and
  Engineering Education Health and Biotechnology
High Tech Telecommunications
Transportation 
Aerospace and Defense
Construction and
  Engineering
Education
Health and Biotechnology
High Tech
Telecommunications
Transportation
An example of an APT18 phishing email is shown in Figure 2:

FROM:  <various> @duwrt.com

SUBJECT: Important:Flash Update

Body:
Dear,
If you already have Flash installed on
  your computer, you'll be asked to download and install update. Once
  the new update is installed, Flash should function normally. Update
  Outlook Many Flash problems can be solved by updating your client
  software to the latest version. Please verify that you have all the
  latest updates available for your version of Adobe flash software.
  Here's how:
1.Download update
    hxxp://get[.]adobe[.]com/ (masked URL: hxxp://137.175.4[.]132/index.htm)
2.Click Check for Updates.
3.Restart your computer after you have
  verified that all updates are installed. You must have administrative
  privileges on your computer to install any Flash. Please contact your
  desktop support staff if you need assistance.
        Figure 2:  An example of APT18 phishing email using CVE-2015-5119
Once the victim clicks the URL, the system downloads a malicious
  Adobe Flash (.swf) file with the properties shown in Figure 3.
Filename:  movie.swf
MD5:  079a440bee0f86d8a59ebc5c4b523a07
Filesize:  214976
        Figure 3: APT18 Malicious SWF Properties
Upon exploitation, a GH0ST RAT variant is delivered to the victims’
  system, which calls out to a previously known APT18 CnC address
  223.25.233.248. GH0ST RAT is a backdoor derived from public source
  code. It may also be detected as Backdoor.APT.Gh0stRat. The compiled
  source code provides attackers with many ways to control a victim’s
  system, including the ability to create, manipulate, delete, launch,
  or transfer files; perform screen or audio capture; enable a webcam;
  list or kill processes; open a command shell; and wipe event logs.
  However, since the source code is public, threat groups may tailor the
  code by removing or adding functionality.
Comparing the Campaigns
APT3 and APT18 took a slightly different approach in employing the
  exploit, which demonstrates they likely work independently. As usual,
  APT3 used compromised infrastructure, while APT18 relied on procured
  infrastructure. APT3 used customized phishing emails that sometimes
  contained the names of the targeted organizations, whereas APT18’s
  emails were nonspecific and likely crafted to be used on multiple targets.
Quick Turnaround Time Demonstrates Adaptability and Opportunism
The groups demonstrated their adaptability and skill by quickly
  employing Hacking Team’s leaked zero-day before the vulnerability was
  patched. Both groups likely monitor information from security research
  to learn what exploits are available and how network defenders are
  reacting to them. We have previously observed APT3 monitoring and
  quickly changing tactics based on public research. After we exposed
  details about Operation Clandestine Wolf, APT3 changed its phishing
  emails, modified filenames, and updated its backdoor.
In the past, APT3 and APT18 have frequently developed or adapted
  zero-day exploits for operations, which were likely planned in
  advance. Using data from the Hacking Team leak demonstrates how they
  can shift resources—selecting targets, preparing infrastructure,
  crafting messages, and updating tools—to take advantage of unexpected
  opportunities like newly exposed exploits.
Recommendations
FireEye maintains endpoint and network detection for CVE-2015-5119,
  the backdoors used in these campaigns, and other tools used by these
  groups. Additionally, we highly recommend:
 Applying Adobe’s patch
    for Flash immediately, Querying for additional activity by
    source addresses or email indicators, Blocking CnC
    addresses via outbound communications, and Scope the
    environment to prepare for incident response.
