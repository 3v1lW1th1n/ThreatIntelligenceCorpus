Rat Brain and Computer Security


Hey folks,today my big news is about "the rat brain". Yea, some researchers in University of Reading (UK) build one of the first prototypes of robots working with true "animal" cells. Here the main page of the project Here the video:That's awesome and it seems to have infinite way to be utilized. Let's think about security, like for example patterns recognition (like CAPTCHA) or Intrusion Systems or again Intelligent HoneyNet able to follow perceptively attacks trees and so forth. Apply "Brain Computing" ( "Neural Systems" .. or whatever they call it) will be the next big challenge for security engineers, and maybe the biggest challenge ever for hacking communities.
