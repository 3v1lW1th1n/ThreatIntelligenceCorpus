Aruba! Aruba! Patch now, patch fast!
Aruba Networks is slinging patches at a bunch of vulnerabilities in management platforms, its Aruba Instant Platform, and its proprietary ArubaOS PAPI management API.
The company posted three advisories here after Google put it on a 90-day deadline, with the Chocolate Factory's Sven Blumenstein dropping a consolidated report of 26 individual vulns at Full Disclosure on Friday.
Al are considered “urgent”, according to the HP subsidiary.
In a tone of some irritation, Aruba says it's “reminding” customers that PAPI “is not a secure protocol”.
The updated disclosure was issued because Blumenstein's post went beyond what Aruba had already disclosed, to include details of vulnerabilities. These include:
Aruba says customers should read up on mitigation in its Control Plane Security Best Practices at Aruba support.
In a set of vulnerabilities covered by CVE-2016-2031, the company has announced fixes for its Aruba Instant platform (AIP).
Users need to upgrade to IAP version 4.3.2.1 or 4.1.3.0 depending on the kit they run, to patch bugs that include:
AirWave Management Platform software in the 8.x series, prior to version 8.2, rounds out the bug-hunt.
The bugs disclosed in CVE-2016-2032 include an exposed RabbitMQ management interface; weak XSRF token generation; and an exposed NTP configuration file that attackers could modify. AirWave users are told to upgrade to version 8.2.0 or higher.
Both AirWave and Aruba Instant also inherit the PAPI protocol issues disclosed in CVE-2016-2032. ®
