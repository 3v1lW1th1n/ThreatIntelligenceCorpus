Pattern lock are not enough to protect our Smartphone because  hackers are able to log swipe gestures with a malware. The news was reported by Forbes, Neal Hindocha, a senior security consultant for Trustwave, has designed a Screenlogging malware that can monitor finger swipes on smart devices in combination with taking screenshots, painting a picture of exactly how the user is interacting with their phone or tablet.

records the input typed into the keyboard and it is able to intercept users’ passwords for email, social media and any other service. 
Recording touch screen coordinates “has a certain value in itself,” “If you’re monitoring all touch events and the phone hasn’t been touched for at least one hour, then you get a minimum of four touch events, you can assume that is a PIN code being entered.” “The more interesting thing is, if you get a screenshot and then overlay the touch events, you’re looking at a screenshot of what the user is seeing, combined with dots, sequentially, where the user is touching the screen.” Hindocha says.
The Screenlogging malware  monitors the inputs taped and swiped on the screen recording the X and Y coordinates where the user has touched the screen, the data are then used to so a hacker would know what the user is doing and on which application.
