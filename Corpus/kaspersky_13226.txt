Why do you need a VPN?
Here on Kaspersky Daily, you can find four detailed articles that explain what exactly a virtual private network (VPN) is and why people use VPNs, describe the different ways to implement virtual private networking, and discuss other related topics. But not all of our readers want to dig so deep. Many would prefer a very brief explanation — just one sentence answering the key questions: What is a VPN and why should I use one?
We honestly think it’s impossible to explain everything in one sentence — nobody can cover in a few words what virtual private networks are, how they work, and why they are so useful. So we decided to focus on one important question — “Why do you need a VPN?” — and explain everything in one picture.
We think that it clearly shows the difference in the routes your data takes when using and not using VPN.
