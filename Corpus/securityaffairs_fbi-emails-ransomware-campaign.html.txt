					Watch out, cyber criminals are using fake FBI emails to infect your computer					
The Feds’ Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is warning of a new spam campaign aimed at infecting victims with a ransomware. According to an alert issued on Wednesday by the IC3, numerous citizens filled complaints after received emails purporting to be from IC3. The message pretends to be the compensation from a cyber attack and asks the victims to fill the attached document, but the file is laced with malware.
The story is interesting, the email reports that a Nigerian cyber criminal had been arrested and feds have found the recipient’s email address of the alleged scammer’s PC. The email asks victims to return the document with recipient info and wait for the refund to arrive. Once the victim has opened the document, the infection process will start.

The FBI has identified at least three other versions of the IC3 impersonation scam:
FBI is currently investigating the cases, victims of an online scam can file a complaint with the IC3 at www.ic3.gov.
