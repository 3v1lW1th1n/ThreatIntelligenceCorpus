LookingGlass Weekly Phishing Report – August 31, 2015
Week of August 23 – 29, 2015
Author: Robert McDaniel

In this week’s phishing activity report, we saw more than a >13% increase in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. This was mainly driven by three industries: Internet Content Providers (>195%), Telecommunications (>90%), and Banking (>90%), which saw large spikes in phishing activity last week.  We saw nominal decreases in phishing activity for eCommerce (>15%), Storage & Systems Management Software (>15%),  and Electronic Payment Systems (>15%).

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
