Google Fixes 159 Flaws in Chrome
Google updates its Chrome browser on a very aggressive timeline, often a couple of times a month. Usually, each update includes a handful of security fixes, maybe 12 or 15. On Tuesday, the company released Chrome 38, which patched a staggering 159 vulnerabilities.
The huge majority of those patches–113 of them–fix minor vulnerabilities in the browser, but Google also fixed several high-risk flaws and one critical bug that earned the researcher who reported it a reward of more than $27,000. That reward is for a combination of vulnerabilities in the V8 engine and IPC that can enable an attacker to escape the Chrome sandbox and execute arbitrary code. Researcher Juri Aedla received a reward of $27,633.70 for reporting that series of flaws to Google.
In all, Google awarded more than $52,000 in rewards to researchers who reported vulnerabilities fixed in this release. Among the vulnerabilities that Google patched are four use-after-free flaws rated as high risks. There are two other high-risk vulnerabilities, as well as four medium-rated ones and low-risk flaw. Here’s the full list of bugs fixed in Chrome 38:
