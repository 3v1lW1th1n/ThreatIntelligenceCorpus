					Visa payments DOWN: Millions affected by a service disruption					
Shoppers and travelers were unable to make payments with their cards since at around 2.30pm on Friday across Europe.
At the time of writing, Visa confirmed the widespread problems but did not provide any details on the cause.

Visa and major banks informed their customers also through social media, while major retailers confirmed that users were not able to pay with their cards.
The problems suffered by Visa Payments are currently affecting also MasterCard and Amex because the two services were rerouting some transactions via Visa’s IT network.

We are aware some customers are experiencing Visa debit card issues. This is impacting multiple banks across Europe. We will update when we know more. Cash withdrawals can be made at any BOI ATM.
