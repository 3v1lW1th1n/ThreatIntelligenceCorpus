Exploits are everywhere — is your business safe?
Over the past few weeks, cybersecurity seemed to steal the spotlight everywhere in world news. A major hotel chain saw a thousand hotels confirm a credit card breach, a major patch from Microsoft, Google fixing a phishing vulnerability within Chrome and our old friends the Equation Group making the news at six and 11.

All of the events are different and had different impacts, but they all highlighted the fact that we live in a digital and physical world where anything connected to the Web can be hacked with just a single exploit.

Typically, when cybersecurity news breaks, you will hear a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt about what the real risk was or is. Luckily, our Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) is constantly monitoring the threat landscape.

Last week, the group rolled out a new report entitled “Exploits: how great is the threat?”
The report is quite detailed and worth the read for corporate IT professionals or anyone interested in learning more about the landscape we’re now facing. However, for those of you with little time to spare, we’ve highlighted three points that we think IT teams should be aware of and be prepared for.
Within the report, among the top 10 vulnerabilities exploited were on Windows OS, Flash, Java, and Microsoft Office. At this point, that should not be a surprise to anyone, but it should raise concerns for corporate teams in security, IT, and data protection.
So, what can you do? For starters, take the security of your organization seriously. Look for areas of weakness and educate yourself on ways to fix them or to bring in outside help to assist you. Also keep these five tips from GReAT in mind for your network.
