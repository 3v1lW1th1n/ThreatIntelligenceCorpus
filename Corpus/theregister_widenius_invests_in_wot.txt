MySQL daddy juices Finnish security firm
MySQL creator Michael "Monty" Widenius is injecting some venture capital and executive experience into a Finnish firm that makes a community-driven security add-on for browsers.
A native of Finland, Widenius invested an undisclosed sum into the coffers of Web of Trust, which makes the titular add-on WOT for Firefox and Internet Explorer. He'll also take a seat on the company's board of directors.
WOT is a free add-on that displays a safety rating next to search results from Google, Yahoo, Wikipedia, and others. The rating (either a green, yellow, or red badge) is based on opinions of a web site's risk solicited from WOT users. The company claims 3 million downloads and ratings for 21 million websites.
"I am thrilled to join the Web of Trust team and will do my best to help it reach new heights," Widenius stated on the WOT blog. "My years at MySQL have taught me the power of user-driven services, and I appreciate the value the contribution that each of you provide to the Web of Trust community by rating and commenting on websites!"
Widenius left Sun after a long-standing dispute over what he saw as a "premature" and "bug-ridden" release of MySQL 5.1.
He's also supposedly opening a restaurant that will use databases "to achieve a better customer experience." We hear the implicit primary key burger is terrific. ®
