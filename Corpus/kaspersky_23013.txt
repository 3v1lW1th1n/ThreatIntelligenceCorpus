The Good, the bad, or the ugly?
If you are building a system for software categorization, make secure gateways, or work on an incident response team, you know that the information that can be found in a file is not always enough. Sometimes it is useful to know the public URL from which the file was downloaded, information about the corresponding product and its vendor, data on digital signatures and certificates, or statistical information.
Where can you get such information to augment your security-related solution or service? Whitelisting services contain only information about legitimate software. Stream-based threat feeds can help catch a threat, but they lack the details needed for forensics. That is why we decided to make a new service, one that can provide access to our knowledge on any file, be it good, bad, or gray.
This new service, Kaspersky Online File Reputation, can provide a detailed dossier on any file Kaspersky Lab systems have encountered. Here are the main advantages of this service:
It’s quite rare to be able to check some of those aspects. For example, if you encounter a yet-unknown, but digitally signed file, we can provide information based on the digital fingerprint of the certificate, which can be sent with the file’s hash. Our service will determine whose certificate it is, check if it’s stolen or expired, and return a verdict on whether the file can be trusted — even if no one has ever seen it before. That may sound a little strange, but keep in mind that some companies give their clients unique, signed installers. Google and Dropbox work that way, and even Microsoft Windows generates unique files for each PC.
