					OpDomesticTerrorism – Anonymous takes down Charlottesville website after the incident					
The hacktivist collective Anonymous launched the OpDomesticTerrorism and claimed responsibility for carrying out a DDoS attack on the official website of Charlottesville city Virginia. The website went offline under the prolonged attack that was powered in the wake of the incident in which many protestors were hit while protesting the rally organized by a group of white supremacists.
A car rammed into a crowd, killing one person and injuring over a dozen others. The police arrested the 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio.
Immediately after the incident, members of the activist group Anonymous launched a series of DDoS attacks on the Charlottesville city website.

According to HackRead who received a comment from an Anonymous member that operates the Twitter account @YourAnonGlobal, the attack was carried out by New World Hackers (NWH).
The NWH confirmed to HackRead.com that they are the one behind the attack on Charlottesville city website.
“At the time we saw the police were not so helpful, they left the people to die which forced us to targeted the Charlottesville website to give them a message.” said one of the NWH’s members.
“New World Hackers are back, and we are delivering our own version of justice to the KKK, and government, in which ever way we please.”
The message spread by @YourAnonGlobal about the attack states:
“Our strategy relies on the unity of these direct actions (DDOS), as the ballot box is no defense against fascism and hatred, nor are the political parties in power now. We are seeing that victories we have won through hard struggle could very well be reversed. Our only chance is to build a movement that relies on the power of the people.”
