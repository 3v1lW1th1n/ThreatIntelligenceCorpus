Andrew S. Tanenbaum on Voting System.


The interesting reading on Voting System written by Tanenbaum is available for free here. He wrote:Electronic voting has real advantages over paper ballots as long as the focus is on a voting system, not a voting machine.I think this sentence is really important for who's researching in that field, too many time people focalize the "security properties" on voting devices (aka voting machines) forgetting that having all the part of the system secured doesn't mean having a secure system.
