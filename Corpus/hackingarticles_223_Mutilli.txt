In the next step, you can choose to install portable version of XAMPP on a USB drive. However, you will not be able to use services with a portable installation. Type y and Hit Enter

The setup will now relocate XAMPP to the correct path if required. Once you see the ‘XAMPP’ is ready to use’ message, Type Return to Continue

Next you will see a message informing the time zone that was set in php.ini file. Again Type Return to Continue

In the last step of the installation, you are given various choices, amongst which the first one is to start the XAMPP control panel. Note that even if you exit the set up at this point by entering x, you can always start the XAMPP control panel either from Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

After the installation is complete, you will find XAMPP under Start | Programs | XAMPP. You can use the XAMPP Control Panel to start/stop all servers and also install/uninstall services.

Note that the XAMPP installation contains a folder named “htdocs”. For example, if XAMPP is installed to “C:xampp” then there is an htdocs directory located at “C:xampphtdocs”. The “htdocs” folder is where web applications are placed.

Remove PHP Error
They are not compatible with the OWASP ESAPI classes in use in Mutillidae 2.0. The error modifies headers disrupting functionality so this is not simply an annoyance issue. To do this, go to the PHP.INI file and change the line that reads “error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT” to “error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_WARNING & ~E_DEPRECIATED“.
Important note: If you use XAMPP Lite or various version of XAMPP on various operating systems, the path for your php.ini file may vary. You may even have multiple php.ini files in which case try to modify the one in the Apache directory first, then the one in the PHP file if that doesnt do the trick.
Windows possible default location C:xamppphpphp.ini, C:XamppLitePHPphp.ini, others Linux possible default locations: /XamppLite/PHP/php.ini, /XamppLite/apache/bin/php.ini, others 

Once the modification is complete, restart the Apache service. If you are not sure how to restart the service, reboot
