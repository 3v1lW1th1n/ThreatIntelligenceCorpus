The gaming industry is in full storm after the massive outage of PSN and Xbox live at Christmas caused by the Lizard Squad. This time is the leakage online of the software development kit (SDK) for the Xbox Live to worry the experts of the gaming industry. The SDK is circulating online thanks to a group calling itself H4LT, the availability of the Microsoft Xbox One developer SDK opens the door for homemade applications, this means that unapproved developers will be able to develop unofficial software and experts believe they will be able to design also specific crack for the popular console.

Hey, @Xbox! We thought we’d drop on by and End 2014 with a Bang 😉 https://t.co/dQH9CIPrb0— areWeH4LT (@notHALT) 30 Dicembre 2014
TechGame succeeded to contact the group which provided the following explanation for the Xbox Development Kit:
“We leaked it to the community because if something is shared then.. progress is achieved faster than alone. Something kept between us will not achieve anything. Share it with the community = creativity and research. Shared is how it should be. The SDK will basically allow the community to reverse and open doors towards homebrew applications being present on the Xbox One.“
The H4LT group anyway explained that it has no link with the Lizard Squad and its members.
“You had fun by taking down servers. Can we have fun for leak-*cough* giving out this?” is the content of a weet sent by H4LT to Lizard Squad.
Despite there isn’t an official exploit to run homebrew applications on the console it is easy to predict that someone will be able to do it in the next future.
“Once the SDK is out, people who have knowledge or has in the past reversed files related to the Windows (8) operating system should definitely have a go at reversing some files in there,” the group added. “Why? Well, the Xbox One is practically a stripped Windows 8 device and has introduced a new package format that hasn’t had much attention. This format is responsible for updating the console and storing applications (Games are under the category of ‘Applications’ on the Xbox One) and is a modification of Virtual Hard Disks.“
Stay tuned for further information …be sure that the experts are already analyzing the code. …be sure that the experts are already analyzing the code.
