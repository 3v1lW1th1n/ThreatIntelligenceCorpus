Linux Torvalds during a question-and-answer ‪session ‬at ‪the LinuxCon publicly admitted that the US Government requested him to insert a backdoor into Linux kernel. The circumstance must induce a reflection in all those experts that believe open source software is the unique possible reply to elude surveillance programs such as PRISM and BullRun.
Torvalds, considered the father of Linux kernel, attended the Linuxcon conference in New Orleans today with other top Linux developers, he replied to question on his OS, Microsoft, and other issues related to the events occurred in the last months.
 

 
“Linux usage keeps changing. Linux today is very different from even ten years ago,” “I hope it will continue to meet new use cases.” said Torvalds.
Interesting an an anecdote explained by Torvalds, when he started he didn’t have money to run Unix on his own machine. He had to learn programming to create its own cheap system.
