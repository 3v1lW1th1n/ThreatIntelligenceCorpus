
					Largest Ever 400Gbps Distributed Denial of Service NTP Amplification attack hit Cloudfare					
“Very big NTP reflection attack hitting us right now. Appears to be bigger than the #Spamhaus attack from last year. Mitigating,”  “Someone’s got a big, new cannon. Start of ugly things to come,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Price said in a tweet.
Attackers exploited weaknesses in the Network Time Protocol (NTP), it is a networking protocol widely used  for the clock synchronization purpose between systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.
” NTP might become a vector for DDoS attacks because, like DNS, it is a simple UDP-based protocol that can be persuaded to return a large reply to a small request. Unfortunately, that prediction has come true.” reported the official post.
Recently, The US-CERT issued an Alert (TA14-017A) for
UDP-based Amplification Attacks listing the UDP protocols identified as potential attack vectors for this category of  Distributed Denial of Service attack.
CVE has already coded the Network Time Protocol vulnerability as CVE-2013-5211, the attackers exploit the monlist command for the offensives.
