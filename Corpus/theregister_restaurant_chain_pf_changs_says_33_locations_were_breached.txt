If you ate at one of these PF Chang's restaurants, your bank card is at risk
US eatery chain P.F. Chang's has named 33 of its restaurants that were compromised by bank card fraudsters this year.
The company said payment systems at its Chinese bistros in states from California to Florida were infiltrated, allowing crooks to siphon off victims' credit and debit card details.
According to the restaurant chain, the security breach occurred between October of 2013 and June of 2014, when the slurping was discovered. In the aftermath of the scam, the company briefly took its card systems offline and used carbon paper images.
The breached restaurants include eight locations California, three in Pennsylvania, and two in Washington.
"We have determined that the security of our card processing systems was compromised, and we have reason to believe that the intruder may have stolen some data from certain credit and debit cards that were used during specified time frames at 33 P.F. Chang's China Bistro branded restaurant locations in the continental United States," the company said.
"The potentially stolen data includes the card number and in some cases also the cardholder's name and/or the card's expiration date. However, we have not determined that any specific cardholder's credit or debit card data was stolen by the intruder."
The company said that it will pay for identity protection services for customers exposed by the breach.
P.F. Chang's is not alone in experiencing a high-profile breach of customer data. Last year, retail giant Target lost card details for 40 million customers, while online market eBay and tickets site StubHub each fell victim to security breaches. ®
