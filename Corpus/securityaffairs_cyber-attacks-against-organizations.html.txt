The CyberEdge Group published an interesting report, titled “2015 Cyberthreat Defense Report” that in line with similar studies confirms the increase in the number of successful cyber attacks against organizations.
The report analyzed data provided by 814 organizations, it surveyed IT security decision makers and practitioners in 19 industries across North America and Europe.
71 percent of respondents confirmed that their organization was compromised by a successful cyber attack last year, meanwhile the percentage related to the previous year was 62 percent. Most disconcerting is the data related to multiple cyber attacks suffered by the organizations, 22 percent declared that their organization experienced six or more successful cyber attacks.
According to the experts, one of the principal reasons for the rise in the number of cyber attacks is the level of sophistication of the attackers’ tactics. Phishing attacks, malware and zero-day attacks are the principal attack vectors exploited by bad actors in the wild. Today I published a blog post on the ICS-CERT Monitor report that confirms the data provided by the CyberEdge Group in his survey.
Below other interesting findings from the survey related to cyber attacks against organizations:
