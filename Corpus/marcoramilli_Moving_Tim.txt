Moving Time


Hello Everybody,It's something like 20 days I don't write here; the reasons are lots of projects I am still working on which I need to finish before my leaving for Washington DC. Yea folks, I'm going to work for NIST (National Institute od Standar and Technologies) in Security.I'll work in Electronic Voting Machine security, in particular on OEVT (Open Ended Vulnerability Testing). This is the main motive of my absentee during these days and during next month.I'll probably write something more about my new stay in US and my security projects but, probably, in late august.Until late august I'll write only the most interesting things... to me. :DHave a nice summer and wonderful holidays.
