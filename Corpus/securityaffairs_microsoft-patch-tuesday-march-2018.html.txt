					What’s new in Microsoft Patch Tuesday updates for March 2018?					
Microsoft Patch Tuesday updates for March 2018 address 75 vulnerabilities, all the critical flaws fixed this month affect the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers.
Most of the critical vulnerabilities are remote code execution flaws that are related to the way browser scripting engines handle objects in memory.
One of the critical vulnerabilities fixed by the Microsoft Patch Tuesday can lead to the disclosure of information that can be leveraged to further hack the targeted system.
Two vulnerabilities fixed this month, a denial-of-service (DoS) issue in ASP.NET 2.0 (CVE-2018-0808) and a privilege escalation in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 through 2016 editions (CVE-2018-0940), have been publicly disclosed before patches became available, but according to Microsoft, there is no news about their exploitation in the wild.
Microsoft also fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability that resides in the Windows installer and that could be exploited by an authenticated attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated permissions.
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Credential Security Support Provider protocol (CredSSP).
One of the most debated issues fixed by Microsoft is the CredSSP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-0886) that affects all versions of Windows to date.
The flaw could be used by a remote attacker to exploit RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to steal data and run malicious code.
The vulnerability is a logical cryptographic issue in CredSSP that can be exploited by an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to steal session authentication data and perform a Remote Procedure Call attack.
