Google to admins: We'll tell you when your network is pwned
Google software engineer Nav Jagpal says it will start sharing URLs linked to social engineering, unwanted and malicious software, to help network administrators understand the threats they face.
Google is monitoring some 22,000 autonomous systems (ASNs) or about 40 percent of total active networks, and provides some 250 reports each day to some 1300 administrators. The Alphabet subsidiary's done so since 2011.
Now the company hopes to expand those numbers and is calling for administrators to sign up.
Jagpal says administrators who take part will gain more insight into the security and integrity of their own networks.
The threat man says Google hopes "... to provide network admins with even more useful information for protecting their users, we’re adding URLs related to unwanted software, malicious software, and social engineering to the set of information we share."
"By working together, we can make it more challenging and expensive for attackers to profit from user harm."
Google alerts administrators to malicious drive-by-downloads and exploits, malicious distribution domains, social engineering sites, unwanted malware like ad-injectors, and traditional trojans.
It is the latest move by Google to scrub out net nasties, including a crack-down on advertising injectors, infected web sites, and absent SSL.®
