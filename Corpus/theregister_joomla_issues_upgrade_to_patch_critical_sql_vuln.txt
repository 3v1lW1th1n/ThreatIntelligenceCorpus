Joomla issues upgrade to patch critical SQL vuln
Joomla's developers have moved to fix a critical SQL injection vulnerability – but are coming under fire for taking a month to address the issue.
The version 3.2.3 update, available since late last week, is described by Joomla as fixing a high priority core SQL injection bug (along with two medium priority XSS bugs and an unauthorised login bug).
However, according to ThreatPost, researchers at Sucuri have associated the SQL fix with a month-old vulnerability that was described at exploit-db.com.
The Scip vulnerability database provides this description: “Affected by this issue is an unknown function of the file /index.php/weblinks-categories.
"The manipulation of the argument id with the input value 0%20%29%20union%20select%20password%20from%20%60k59cv_users%60%20--%20%29 leads to a sql injection vulnerability. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.”
Secunia has this to say about the SQL vulnerability:
“Certain input is not properly sanitised in the "ModTagssimilarHelper::getList()" method (modules/mod_tags_similar/helper.php) before being used in a SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the use of the Similar Tags module.”
The two XSS bugs arise from inadequate escaping, while the other bug allowed improper logins using Gmail authentication. ®
