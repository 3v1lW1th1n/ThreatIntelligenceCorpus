a Nice reading for your week-end


Hi folks,this morning I had this reading on iPhone passcode bugs. Written on 09/02/2009 it's an interesting exeriment on iPhone security.As an IT security professional, I was tasked with evaluating the iPhoneâ€™s security features for the enterprise (more iPhone management tests here). Over the past few weeks, I have been testing different aspects of the new iPhone 3GS, particularly the interaction with Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) and device password policies. During my testing, I discovered some strange behaviors with how the iPhone handles device password policies, as well as passwords altogether.Have a nice reading.
