6 Ways to Hack SSH Login Password

In this article, we will learn how to gain control over our victim’s PC through SSH Port. There are various ways to do it and let take time and learn all those because different circumstances call for different measure.
Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more
 Now, we need to choose a wordlist. As with any dictionary attack, the wordlist is key. Kali has numerous wordlists built right in.
Run the following command
 hydra -L /root/Desktop/user.txt -P /root/Desktop/pass.txt 192.168.1.103 ssh
Once the commands are executed it will start applying the dictionary attack and so you will have the right username and password in no time. After a few minutes, Hydra crack the credential, as you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the SSH username as pavan and password as toor.

This is the graphical version to apply dictionary attack via SSH port to hack a system. For this method to work:
Open xHydra in your kali. And select Single Target option and their give the IP of your victim PC. And select ssh in box against Protocol option and give the port number 22 against the port option.

Now, go to Passwords tab and select Username List and give the path of your text file, which contains usernames, in the box adjacent to it.
Then select Password List and give the path of your text file, which contains all the passwords, in the box adjacent to it.

After doing this, go to Start tab and click on Start button on the left.
Now, the process of dictionary attack will start. Thus, you will attain the username and password of your victim.

Medusa is a speedy, parallel, and modular, login brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many services which allow remote authentication as possible
 Run the following command
medusa -h 192.168.1.103 -U /root/Desktop/user.txt -P /root/Desktop/pass.txt -M ssh
Now, the process of dictionary attack will start. Thus, you will attain the username and password of your victim.

Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. 
Run the following command
ncrack –v –U /root/Desktop/user.txt –P /root/Desktop/pass.txt 192.168.1.103:22

 Patator is a multi-purpose brute-forcer, with a modular design and a flexible usage. It is quite useful for making brute force attack on several ports such as FTP, HTTP, SMB and etc.
patator ssh_login host=192.168.1.103 user=FILE0 0=/root/Desktop/user.txt password=FILE1 1=/root/Desktop/pass.txt 

From given below image you can observe that the process of dictionary attack starts and thus, you will attain the username and password of your victim.

This module will test ssh logins on a range of machines and report successful logins. If you have loaded a database plugin and connected to a database this module will record successful logins and hosts so you can track your access.
Open Kali terminal type msfconsole
Now type use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
msf exploit (ssh_login)>set rhosts 192.168.1.103 (IP of Remote Host)
msf exploit (ssh_login)>set user_file /root/Desktop/user.txt
msf exploit (ssh_login)>set pass_file /root/Desktop/pass.txt
msf exploit (ssh_login)>exploit
From given below image you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the SSH password and username, moreover metasploit serves an additional benefit by providing remote system command shell for unauthorized access into victim’s system.
