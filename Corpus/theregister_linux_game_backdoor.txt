Linux IRC server leaves backdoor open
A warning today that Linux users are not as immune to security threats as many of them like to believe - anyone who has downloaded the Linux version of IRC server Unreal since November 2009 should check for a trojan.
An Unreal admin said the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz file on its mirrors had been replaced back in 2009 with a version which contained a backdoor. No one noticed the change.
Administrator Syzop apologised for the embarrassing mistake and said precautions had been taken to stop it happening again. In future files will be PGP signed - even if not everyone checks, it should bring problems to light sooner.
Syzop promised more checks on files in future too.
Full details on checking your machine and cleaning it are here. ®
We made our own embarassing mistake earlier, calling Unreal IRC server a first person shooter. Thanks to all the commenters who pointed this out. John Oates will be digitally signed in future.
