Novell GroupWise bug threatens mass email theft
Security researchers have identified two critical holes in Novell's GroupWise WebAccess, the web front end for the company's email and employee collaboration package, that allow malicious hackers to steal user messages with ease. All supported versions of the program are vulnerable.
One vulnerability allows an attacker to forward all of a user's email simply by sending a specially crafted email, according to Adrian Pastor, an employee for ProCheckUp, a penetration testing firm based in London. The cross-site request forgery bug allows attackers to add new forwarding rules simply by tricking a user into opening the email, no clicking of links necessary.
A second security vulnerability is the result of a persistent cross site scripting (XSS) error that allows attackers to remotely run code on a user's computer. Miscreants could exploit the flaw by inserting malicious javascript into an HTML email or by including an HTML attachment.
Pastor, who is also a member of the ethical hacking collective known as GNUCitizen, said he reported the vulnerabilities to Novell previously and the company plans to release patches on Friday. A spokesman said GroupWise updates were planned for Friday but had no other details.
GroupWise is the No. 3 corporate email program, behind Microsoft's Outlook and IBM's Notes. Pastor said versions 6.5x, 7.0, 7.01, 7.02x, 7.03x and 8.0 are vulnerable. ®
