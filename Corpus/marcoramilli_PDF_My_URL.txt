PDF My URL !


A quick post from my mobile device to point out this incredible free service: PDFMyURL.If you are behind a content filter or if you are not sure about the link you are going to open, you may want to use this great free service. It opens the link for you and it prints the home page on a PDF file.Now I gotta some suspected about the security of this method, probably everybody knows about the last trojans propagation through PDF files. It would be interesting to analyze if it is possible to forge a webpage that will introduce Javascript malware into the crafted PFDmyURL's files
