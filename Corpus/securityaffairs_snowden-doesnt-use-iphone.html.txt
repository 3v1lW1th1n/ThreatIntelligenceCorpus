The last revelation will raise new controversy, according to Snowden’s lawyer the popular whistleblower doesn’t use iPhone due to the alleged presence of a surveillance software controlled by the US Intelligence.
“Edward never uses an IPhone, he’s got a simple phone… The iPhone has special software that can activate itself without the owner, having to press a button and gather information about him, that’s why on security grounds he refused to have this phone,” Anatoly Kucherena told RIA Novosti.

Apple denies any claim, but many experts speculate that the NSA is still able to track Apple devices and this declaration seems to confirm it.
Kucherena confirmed that the decision on whether or not to use an iPhone is made based on Snowden’s experience, it’s clear the reference to his activity inside the NSA Intelligence Agency.
Kucherena also confirmed that Snowden will not leave Russia because he is satisfied with his life in Russia, the popular whistleblower was granted asylum since August 1, 2013 and later a three-year residency permit by Russia.
