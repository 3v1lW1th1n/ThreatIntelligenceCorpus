Dick enters the cockpit, takes controls at NTS
Capita IT Services is waving goodbye to Jonathan Lassman, the long-serving managing director at security reseller NTS UK, which Crapita acquired roughly six weeks ago.
Lassman rocked up at NTS in 2004, and is leaving just shy of 10 years at the biz.
A Capita spokeswoman framed the departure as being a personal decision – and it is fairly common for a managing director to split from the business he or she was running when new owners come in.
"Following the acquisition of NTS by Capita, Jonathan Lassman decided he would leave the business to pursue other opportunities," she told The Channel.
The PR hand added Lassman will remain on board during the "transition period" and will "leave in the coming weeks". "The business will continue to be managed by senior managers who have been with NTS for some time," the Capita spokeswoman claimed.
According to his LinkedIn account, ex-NTS sales director Paul Dick is the man that will fill Lassman's office space, a move he made in March.
Prior to NTS, Lassman was sales director at Data Integration, an NAS Overlay account manager at EMC, a sales manager at Viglen, and a PC and Server sales manager at Everex.
Lassman and Dick did not respond to a request for comment. ®
