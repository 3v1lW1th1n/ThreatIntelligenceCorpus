Cyveillance Phishing Report: Top Targets – June 22, 2015
 
Phishing Report: Top Targets
Week of June 14 – 20, 2015

 
This week saw more than a 18% increase in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry.

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted in phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
Last week, we announced a partnership with CYREN to incorporate their Phishing Intelligence Feed into our anti-phishing service. This provides an unparalleled view into global phishing attacks from the earliest moments, enabling us to deliver even more protection for our customers.
