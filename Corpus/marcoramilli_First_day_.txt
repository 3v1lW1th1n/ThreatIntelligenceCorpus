First day at HICSS


Finally I reached Hawaii for Hawaiian International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS) . Today is the first conference day and what I see is a great melting pot of scientists. A good interoperability between different science cultures: from hard core security guys to social scientists through eGov guys. Again my first impression is totally positive, the organization seems to be brilliant and the location is just amazing, the idea of having tons of different scientists closed in a single hotel is the best way to raise up ideas and collaborations. BTW, except for UC folks is there someone of you who is attending HICSS  ? (Shell we meet in the conference hotel talking about security behind a good beer ?).
