					Ubuntu Linux distro is now available for Windows 10					
The three versions of Linux distros are Ubuntu, Fedora, and SUSE.

Users will be able to install the above Linux operating systems on their Windows machine, the novelty is represented by Fedora and SUSE because Ubuntu is already available on the Windows Store for download,
