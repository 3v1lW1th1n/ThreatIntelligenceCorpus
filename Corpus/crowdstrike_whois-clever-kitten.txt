Who is Clever Kitten
Over the last several weeks, CrowdStrike has been discussing some of the dozens of adversaries that the CrowdStrike Intelligence team tracks every day. We revealed a Chinese-based adversary we crypt as Anchor Panda, a group with very specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and a keen interest in maritime operations and naval and aerospace technology. Last week we discussed Numbered Panda, a group that is also based out of China and is fairly well known to the security community, though by many names. The goal in discussing that group was to illuminate the issues with the varied naming systems for characterizing attackers. This week we want to make sure that we draw attention to the fact that there are adversaries active in computer network exploitation besides those with a nexus to China.
