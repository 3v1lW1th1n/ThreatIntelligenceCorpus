Sony shuts down site to investigate possible hack
Sony has temporarily shuttered yet another website following reports it may have suffered an attack by hackers.
The company's Brazilian Music site was inaccessible for much of Tuesday as website engineers investigated a possible security breach, according to news reports. Sony spokesman Tomio Takizawa told Bloomberg News the possible attack may have altered some content but didn't elaborate.
On Friday, a group calling itself LulzSec targeted Sony's movie division in an attack it claimed exposed more than 1 million consumer email addresses and passwords. It claimed the attack on the Sony Pictures website was achieved by exploiting a simple SQL-injection vulnerability, leading to the trove of unencrypted data.
LulzSec has also claimed responsibility for hacks on the PBS television network and affiliates of the FBI. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for any attacks on Sony's Brazilian website.
Security breaches of Sony networks have exposed sensitive data included in more than 100 million accounts and cost the company more than $171 million. ®
