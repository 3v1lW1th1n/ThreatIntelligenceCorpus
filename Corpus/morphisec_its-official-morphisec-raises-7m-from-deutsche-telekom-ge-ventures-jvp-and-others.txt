We’re pleased to share the news about having raised $7 million, which will give us the runway to expand our marketing and sales efforts.
More importantly, the vote of confidence from key players in the industry – Deutsche Telekom, GE and the venture capital firm JVP – is a testament to the uniqueness of our solution, which turns the tables on hackers by using their polymorphic tactics against them.
You can read the full press release here,and media coverage in Silicon Angle (yeah, we do intend to pull the rug from under hackers’ feet ;), Geektime, Dark Reading andDow Jones Venture Wire, among others.
We’re still in stealth but watch this space…we’re starting to share more from our labs, and will be revealing more about our technology soon.
If you’re a company interested in trying it out for your endpoints, please be in touch.
