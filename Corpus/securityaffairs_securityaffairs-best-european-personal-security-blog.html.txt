					#infosec16  SecurityAffairs awarded as Best European Personal Security Blog					
Yesterday, during the fifth annual European Security Blogger Awards at Infosecurity Europe in London SecurityAffairs received the award as Best European Personal Security Blog.
The awards were assigned through a public vote and votes assigned by expert judges. This year the jury of experts included Infosecurity Europe Hall of Fame member Jack Daniel, journalists Matthew Schwartz and John Leyden.
It is incredible, I launched SecurityAffairs 4 years ago, when I was not able to go to sleep because my newborn daughter Alessia was crying all the night, so I decided to start writing about my cyber security.
For me is a double prize, I’m Italian, and the blog is in English, this requested me a supplementary effort. But I love cyber security, and read my name in a list of myths and masters is an honor.

In the last months some friends joined the crew, they helped me for free motivated by my same passion. I must thank my friends and every one of you who voted for Security Affairs. We are so grateful
