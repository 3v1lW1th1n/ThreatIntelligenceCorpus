					Canadian man charged over leak of billions hacked accounts through LeakedSource					
The Canadian man Jordan Evan Bloom (27) was charged with data leak of 3 billion hacked accounts, the man was running a website to collect personal data and login credentials from the victims.
The man was charged in December as part of an investigation dubbed “Project Adoration,” aiming at trafficking in personal data, unauthorized use of computers, and possession of an illicitly obtained property.
The RCMP alleges that Bloom was the administrators of the LeakedSource.com website.
According to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, “Project Adoration” began in 2016, the investigation started after the Canadian police learned that LeakedSource.com was being hosted by servers located in Quebec.
The RCMP conducted the investigation along with The Dutch National Police and the FBI.
According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Evan Bloom earned some 247,000 Canadian dollars (roughly $198,800 US) by selling the data via leakedsource.com.
“This investigation is related to claims about a website operator alleged to have made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling personal information,” said Rafael Alvarado, the officer in charge of the RCMP Cybercrime Investigative Team. “The RCMP will continue to work diligently with our domestic and international law enforcement partners to prosecute online criminality.”
The data was stolen during massive data breaches of popular websites such as LinkedIn and Ashley Madison online dating service.

Clearly, the availability of such kind of data exposes users at risk of identity theft especially if they share the same credentials on differed web services.
Law enforcement shut down Bloom’s website, unfortunately, another domain name operated by the man is still operating because it hosted on bulletproof servers in Russia.
