Disguised impostor clears international flight
Canadian authorities are investigating an Asian man in his early 20's who disguised himself as an “elderly caucasian male” and was en route from Hong Kong to Vancouver before being discovered as an impostor.
“The passenger in question was observed at the beginning of the flight to be an elderly Caucasian male who appeared to have young looking hands,” a confidential intelligence alert (PDF), titled “Unbelievable Case of Concealment” and obtained by CNN, stated. “During the flight the subject attended the washroom and emerged an Asian male that appeared to be in his early 20's.”

The man, whose name and nationality weren't identified, later made a claim for refugee protection, according the alert, which didn't elaborate. It also said that he initially claimed to be in possession of only one bag, but later fessed up to having two additional pieces of luggage. They contained his personal clothing, a pair of gloves and a disguise kit that consisted of a silicone head and neck mask of an elderly Caucasian male, a brown leather cap, glasses and a brown cardigan.
“The subject donned the 'disguise' for [Border Services Officers] and they noted that he very much resembled an elderly Caucasian man, complete with mimicking the movements of an elderly person,” the confidential memorandum continued. “The subject admitted at this time that he had boarded the flight wit the mask on and had removed it several hours later.”
