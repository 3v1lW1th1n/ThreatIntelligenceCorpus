In the last months, many readers contacted me for a newsletter so I decided to launch the service that will be start tomorrow. Subscribing the newsletter, you will receive every week a list of the most interesting articles in the cyber security landscape. The newsletter includes the links from the most important sources in the cyber security field with the intent to give you a complete overview in the cyber arena on a weekly basis.
We are a growing community, that’s why I’m asking your support. Recently I have opened to the opportunity to contribute to SecurityAffairs (if you are interested send me an email to Pierluigi Paganini : pierluigi.paganini@securityaffairs.co) and I’m starting other projects that will involve you.
In the incoming weeks, I’ll start on monthly bases open researches and everyone could contribute … because security is a shared responsibility.
Hurry up, subscribe to the newsletter, tomorrow I’ll send you the first email.
