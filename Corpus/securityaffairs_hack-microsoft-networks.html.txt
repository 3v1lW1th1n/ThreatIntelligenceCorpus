					Two men suspected of being part of international plot to hack Microsoft networks					
Investigators have arrested two men in the UK in connection with an international plot to hack the Microsoft network.
Agents at the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit, are investigating “unauthorised intrusion into networks that Microsoft owns” between January 2017 and March 2017.
The first man, a 22-year-old from Lincolnshire, was arrested on suspicion of gaining unauthorised access to a computer, while the second one is a 25-year-old from Bracknell that was arrested under Computer Misuse Act offences.

The Police seized a number of devices, it is still unclear the information accessed by hackers, any way Microsoft confirmed that no customer data was exposed.
The law enforcement believe the two men are member of a large cyber crime organization operating worldwide.
“This group is spread around the world and therefore the investigation is being coordinated with our various partners,” said Det Sgt Rob Bryan.  SEROCU is conducting a joint investigation with experts from Microsoft and other law enforcement bodies, including the FBI, EUROPOL and the NCA.”
“Today’s action by authorities in the UK represents an important step… Stronger internet security depends on the ability to identify and prosecute cybercriminals. This requires not only a strong technical cybercriminals. This requires not only a strong technical capability, but the willingness to acknowledge issues publicly and refer them to law enforcement.” Reads the statement from Microsoft.
“No company is immune from cybercrime. No customer data was accessed, and we’re confident in the integrity of our software and systems. We have comprehensive measures in place to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks.”
