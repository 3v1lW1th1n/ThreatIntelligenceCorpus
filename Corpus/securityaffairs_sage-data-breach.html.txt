					The accountancy software firm Sage suffered a data breach					
The UK software company Sage is the last victim of a major data breach that might have compromised personal information for employees at 280 UK businesses.
On August 11th, 2016 Sage UK Payroll services started notifying its customers of a security breach that affected its staff payroll systems.
“At this stage, we are unable to confirm if data relating to your company has been affected, however, we felt it necessary to make you aware at this early stage.” is the statement issued by the company.
“We are investigating unauthorised access to customer information using an internal login.” A Sage spokesperson told BBC.
“We cannot comment further whilst we work with the authorities to investigate – but our customers remain our first priority and we are speaking directly with those affected.”
The British authorities are investigating the security breach, the company Sage speculates the involvement of insiders, the “unauthorised access” of data was carried on by someone using an employee login.

The security breach occurred over the past few weeks, according to Richard De Vere at “The AntiSocial Engineer,” an employee was behind the breach.
“It was disclosed that the breach was conducted by an employee – again we see insider threat as the main factor in a breach. I have no doubts that a company such as Sage took great steps in securing their network perimeter but Insider threats can be prevented – nearly always! ” wrote DeVere.
The company is still investigating the incident, it is not clear which information was accessed or leaked by attackers.
The Financial Times reported that attackers may have accessed employee information from company’s customers, including bank account details.
According to De Vere, customers were notified by phone, the company invited them to watch out for suspicious activity on their accounts.
