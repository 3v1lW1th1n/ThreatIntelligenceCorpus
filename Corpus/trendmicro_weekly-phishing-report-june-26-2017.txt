Weekly Phishing Report: June 26, 2017

This week, we saw a >9% decrease in phishing activity. Although overall phishing activity decreased, only two industries from the top 20 brands saw decreases:  Banking (>40%) and Telecommunications (>35%). The industries that saw the biggest increases were: eCommerce (>60%), Computer Hardware (>20%), and Social Networks (>20%).
Compared to last week, two industries – Computer Software and Dating Sites – jumped back into the top 20 list, while Government fell off.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree vieq of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
