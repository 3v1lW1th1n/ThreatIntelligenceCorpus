My motivation is just to cause chaos for fun and make some money
What was your greatest hacking challenge? Which was your latest hack? Can you describe me it?
I never really had a challenge except when I first started and I helped para and anti attempt to get root on .mil which went horribly wrong rofl which wasn’t my fault btw.
My lasted attack was on Steam at approximately 10:40 am December 23rd and I did the attack by being behind iptables on a Linux VPS and dropping all UDP packets, those packets are going to hit the servers then boom it’s offline
What are the 4 tools that cannot be missed in the hacker’s arsenal and why?
4 tools I honestly don’t know. Everyone has a different skill set I’m not the smartest person in the ” scene ”
Which are the most interesting hacking communities on the web today, why?
The most interesting is probably Twitter because it’s fun to mess with people but the most serious are IRC chats that are used by a lot of smart guys.

No, I wasn’t behind that.

I choose my targets by asking my fans or asking people what they think would be the best one.
We often hear about cyber weapons and cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. Do you believe it is real the risk of a major and lethal cyber attack against a critical infrastructure?
Definitely yes
