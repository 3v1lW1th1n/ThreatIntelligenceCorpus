Last year we observed a significant number of data breaches that cause the exposure of a huge quantity of information in the criminal ecosystem. According to the 2015 Identity Fraud Study (“2015 IDENTITY FRAUD: Protecting Vulnerable Populations“) conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research the number identity fraud victims is dropping by three percent from 2013.
Javelin estimates that in the US 12.7 million U.S. consumers were victimized in identity theft last year 2014, meanwhile in 2013 the number of victims was 13.1 million. It’s a good news if we also consider that the total fraud losses dropped from $18 billion in 2013 to $16 billion in 2014 (-12,5%). The study analyzes identity fraud trends for the twelfth consecutive year, it is one of the most interesting study of identity fraud available on the market.

Identity thefts have a significant impact on the finances and spending habits of the victims. According to a survey conducted by Javelin, 28 percent of the 5,000 people interviewed confirmed to avoid merchants after being victims of an identity fraud.
In particular, the Javelin report highlights a significant decrease in fraud based on creating new accounts in the name of the victims. This is a good news, but the worrying observation is that victims take a long time to discover that they have been victims of an identity theft.
