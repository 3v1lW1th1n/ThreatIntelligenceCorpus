LinkedIn DNS hijacked, site offline
LinkedIn is working on its right-on-the-ball-with-security reputation, this time letting slip its domain details.
According to this App.net post:
“LinkedIn just got DNS hijacked, and for the last hour or so, all of your traffic has been sent to a network hosted by this company [confluence-networks.com]. And they don't require SSL, so if you tried to visit, your browser sent your long-lived session cookies in plaintext.” (User @berg)
The Register hasn't yet confirmed that Confluence Networks is receiving the traffic as asserted by Berg, but LinkedIn.com was delivering a big white nothing at Vulture South around 03:15 GMT on 20 June 2013.
LinkedIn says it is working on the issue:
Meanwhile, it requests patience, a commodity that may be in short supply for those who last year had their passwords for the service perused by pilferers. ®
