The security pentester who goes online with the moniker Kapustkiy breached the Paraguay Embassy of Taiwan (www.embapartwroc.com.tw). A few days ado the hacker and his friend Kasimierz (@Kasimierz_) hacked the Indian Embassies in Switzerland, Mali, Romania, Italy, Malawi, and Libya. Kapustkiy and his friend Kasimierz (@Kasimierz_).
Kapustkiy leaked online on Pastebin data included in the database ‘cboss’ that contains the following tables:

The hackers exploited once again an SQli injection flaw in the targeted websites to gain access to the databases.
The archive contains the real names, phone, numbers, and emails of the users. Kapustkiy told me that he targeted an embassy to demonstrate poor security in Asia.
“I want to let the cyber world of Asia know that security is an important issue. Because when we compare the cyber security of Asia to Europe, Asia is really bad.” he told me.
He confirmed me to have hacked the website without the support of any other people.
The archive includes also emails of the employees who are working in the embassy, these are precious data for attackers that would use them to power other cyber attacks later.
Who is the next one? Is it so difficult to protect websites that manage personal information
