Redmond promises IE8 patch is in the pipeline
Microsoft has announced it is working on a patch for a zero day Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability first identified seven months ago.
Perhaps following a report by El Reg, Redmond said it will bake a patch for the flaw which allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on computers running the older Internet Explorer version 8 through drive-by and phishing attacks.
Microsoft formerly told HP's Zero Day Initiative bug reporters users would need to harden their browsers after it examined the flaw in February, but would now issue a fix despite that it saw no impact to customers.
"Public disclosure was limited and does not currently represent risk to Internet Explorer users," a spokesperson said in a statement.
"We are not aware of any exploits resulting from a privately disclosed issue involving Internet Explorer 8 and have not identified any impact to our customers."
The patch would be issued "when it is ready", following thorough testing against a large number of applications and configurations.
Microsoft said users should upgrade to the latest Windows operating system and run Chrome or Firefox the latest version of Internet Explorer.
The Zero Day Initiative bug bounty clearing house dropped the vuln disclosure stating the use-after-flaw existed in Internet Explorers' handling of CMarkup objects.
"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file," the disclosure read. ®
