					Hacker Interviews – Speaking with Francisco J. Rodriguez					

You are one of the world’s most talented cyber security experts, Could you tell me which his your technical background and when you started hacking? 
My first contact with computers issues was at 80’s using my first PC model Amstrad CPC 464. I have always felt very excited with technology and computers related to cyber security. Since I have finished my academic studies, I’ve been recycling and investigating about cyber security issues on my own.
What was your greatest hacking challenge? 
The hardest challenge I faced was the contest to work at Incibe. It consisted in a 24-hour practical challenge about network forensic, hacking, reversing and programming.
What are the 4 tools that cannot be missed in the hacker’s arsenal and why? 
For me, hackers need the following skills: self-learning, passion, persistence and lateral thinking. The most important hacking tools are Linux command line console, netcat, tcpdump and shodan CLI.
Which are the most interesting hacking communities on the web today? 
There are many communities but I really like n0where, thehackerway, http://elhacker.net  and securitytube.
Which is the industry (healthcare, automotive, telecommunication, banking, and so on) most exposed to cyber attacks and why? What scares you more on the internet and why? 
All of them are vulnerable in this hyper-connected world. I am specially concerned about the nuclear industry where consequences would be seriously dangerous. We often hear about cyber weapons and cyber attacks against critical infrastructure.
Do you believe it is real the risk of a major and lethal cyber attack against a critical infrastructure? 
Absolutely yes. There are actually critical infrastructures exposed on Internet. We can find them using online tools like Shodan. It is strictly important to protect them in order to avoid cyberattacks.
