Mastercard facial recog-ware will unlock your money using SELFIES
Mastercard will begin using selfies as a means to verify payments, it is being said.
The "innovation" will allow some 500 pilot users to take a photo instead of punching in PINs, a move MasterCard chief product security officer Ajay Bhalla says will be popular with youth.
Bhalla told CNN Mastercard partnered with all phone manufacturers to produce the biometric beastie.
"The new generation, which is into selfies ... I think they'll find it cool. They'll embrace it," Bhalla says. "This [app] seamlessly integrates biometrics into the overall payment experience.
"You can choose to use your fingerprint or your face - you tap it, the transaction is okayed (sic) and you're done."
Bhalla says the trial will begin in the US shortly with a full scale deployment to follow.
Users will need to hold their mobile phones at eye-level and blink once when instructed for the check-me-out checkout process to complete.

That process is designed to thwart obvious attacks where attackers could use a still image of a victim to verify fraudulent payments.
Bhalla says the image like other biometric forms will be converted to a format such that a person's photo is neither stored nor transmitted in its normal construction.
This is only the latest of several biometric endeavours for Mastercard. Bhalla is also toying with voice and and even heartbeat recognition to verify transactions. Â®
