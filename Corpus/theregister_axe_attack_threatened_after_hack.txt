Attacker pleads guilty to hatchet-job on ISP
A South Australian man is awaiting sentencing after hacking an ISP’s servers and threatening the owner with an axe.
The Herald Sun is reporting that Bryce Quilley pleaded guilty to four charges. They included three counts of “unlawful modification of computer data”, all of which took place on June 14 last year, as well as threatening harm, and threatening to damage property.
As well as threatening the ISP’s owner with an axe, he pleaded guilty to threatening to burn down the business. According to Sophos’ Naked Security blog, Quilley was a former employee of the company he attacked.
While neither the company nor the victim have been named in the court reports, The Register notes that Quilley is identified in Whois as the registrant contact for ngn.net.au, a games network owned by Adelaide ISP NuSkope. Quilley’s Google+ page mentions “NGN” as a former employer.
He has been remanded on bail for sentencing in August. ®
