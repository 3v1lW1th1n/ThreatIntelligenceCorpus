Earlier April, Oracle patched the critical CVE-2018-2628 vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic server, but an Alibaba security researcher @pyn3rd discovered that the proposed fix could be bypassed.

The CVE-2018-2628 flaw was addressed in Oracle’s Critical Patch Update (CPU) security advisory, a remote attacker can easily exploit the vulnerability to completely take over an Oracle WebLogic server.
@pyn3rd added that it is quite easy to bypass the patch:

The popular cyber security expert Kevin Beaumont explained that the mitigation implemented by Oracle seems to only blacklist commands.

Such kind of errors could have serious consequences on the end users, since April 17, (just after Oracle published the quarterly Critical Patch Update (CPU) advisory). experts are observing threat actors started scanning the Internet, searching for Oracle WebLogic servers.
After Oracle published the Critical Patch Updates, the researchers Xinxi published the technical details of the CVE-2018-2628  vulnerability and later a user with moniker ‘Brianwrf’ shared proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub.
The availability of the PoC code caused a spike in scans for port 7001 that runs the vulnerable WebLogic T3 service.
In the following graph from SANS Institute shows the spike in Internet scans for port 7001:
