Recently the UK’s National Crime Agency has issued an alert on a large spam campaign based on CryptoLocker ransomware that is targeting more than 10 million UK based email users. CryptoLocker malware is considered very insidious by users, it encrypts victim’s files and then demands a ransom money to restore access. CryptoLocker was first detected in the wild in September 2013, what makes CryptoLocker so insidious is the way it encrypts the victim’s data using a strong encryption method making impossible to access it without paying the ransom amount. If the victim doesn’t pay the ransom amount in 72 hours, CryptoLocker will delete the decryption key to decrypt all the files on your PC.
