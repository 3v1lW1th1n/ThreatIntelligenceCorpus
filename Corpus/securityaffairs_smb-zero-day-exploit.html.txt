					US-CERT – Warning, Shadow Brokers Hackers are offering an SMB Zero-Day exploit					
The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has issued a warning after the Shadow Brokers hacker group has offered to sell what it claims to be an SMB Zero-Day exploit.
The Shadow Brokers is the hacker crew that leaked a portion of the arsenal of the NSA-Linked Equation Group, a database containing hacking tools and exploits.
A few days ago the notorious hacker group Shadow Brokers announced the sale of an archive of  Windows exploits and hacking tools stolen from the Equation group.
The mysterious hacking group has apparently decided to put an end to their failed attempts to sell exploits and hacking tools they claimed to have stolen from the NSA-linked Equation Group.
While the group claims to have decided to retire, the stolen exploits are still up for sale for the price of 10,000 bitcoins (roughly $8.7 million at the current exchange).
The precious archive seems to include also a zero-day exploit targeting the Server Message Block (SMB) network file sharing protocol.
“In response to public reporting of a potential Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerability, US-CERT is providing known best practices related to SMB. This service is universally available for Windows systems, and legacy versions of SMB protocols could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from affected systems,” US-CERT said.
Giving a close look at the list published by Shadow Brokers team it is possible to note a tool that claims to be an SMB Zero-Day exploit that goes for 250 bitcoins. The hackers describe the exploit as a remote code execution zero-day targeting SMB. The group is offering it under the name “SMB cloaked backdoor” for 50 bitcoins, but the complete package includes IIS, RDP RPC and SMB exploits for 250 bitcoins.

The US-CERT has advised users and administrators to consider disabling SMB v1, and block all versions of SMB at the network boundary. SMB typically uses port 445 (TCP/UDP), ports 137 and 138 (UDP), and port 139 (TCP).
The US-CERT provided the following recommendations to users and administrators:
Anyway, it is important to consider that disabling or blocking SMB may create problems by obstructing access to shared files, data, or devices.
“The benefits of mitigation should be weighed against potential disruptions to users. For more information on SMB, please review Microsoft Security Advisories 2696547(link is external) and 204279(link is external).” continues the advisory.
The US-CERT has already issued in the past an alert following a Shadow Brokers initiative, in September it warned organizations after the hacker crew leaked exploitation tools flaws affecting Cisco ASA solutions.
“In August 2016, a group known as “Shadow Brokers” publicly released a large number of files, including exploitation tools for both old and newly exposed vulnerabilities. Cisco ASA devices were found to be vulnerable to the released exploit code. In response, Cisco released an update to address a newly disclosed Cisco ASA Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-6366).”
