TeslaCrypt has gone away, ransomware problem hasn’t
In a highly surprising move, the notorious Teslacrypt authors have wrapped up their operation and even released the ransomware’s master key, so that all victims of this particular ransomware can now regain control of their files — without paying anything to anyone.
So far, the reason behind Teslacrypt’s shutdown is unknown, as is the reason its creators have made the generous gesture of giving out its master key. But they have done so — and even published “we are sorry” message on their now-defunct site
Bleeping Computer reports that the previous distributors of TeslaCrypt have switched over to distributing the already-notorious CryptXXX ransomware.
TeslaCrypt was among the most successful and dangerous ransomware campaigns of late. Its sudden termination is a mystery. However, TeslaCrypt isn’t the only ransomware terrorizing users and businesses. It is still necessary to take precautions.
