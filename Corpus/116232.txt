Mike Mimoso talks to Kaspersky Lab researcher Vitaly Kamluk who was critical in the discovery of the latest version of the cross-platform Adwind RAT. The remote access Trojan is unique in that it’s written in Java, giving this version—which is also known as Frutas, AlienSpy and JSocket—the flexibility to be used liberally in cybercrime operations as well as in targeted attacks.
