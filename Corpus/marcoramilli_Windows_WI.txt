Windows WIN32 System Call Table


Today I found this URL pointing out a very interesting Table . This table shows the the System Calls codes for Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 2008 Server and Windows 7.Obviously these codes are really interesting for shellcodes and memory hookers. ;)Enjoy the table.
