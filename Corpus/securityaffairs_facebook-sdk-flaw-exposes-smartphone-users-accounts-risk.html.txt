The Facebook SDK allows the easy integration of mobile apps with Facebook platform, in particular to implement Login with Facebook authentication and reading and writing to Facebook APIs. The “Login as Facebook” authentication mechanism is the Facebook implementation of the open standard for authorization OAuth which provides client applications a ‘secure delegated access’ to resources on behalf of a resource owner.

“I followed up with our Platform team to see if there were any changes they wanted to make here: – On the Android side we‘ve concluded that we will not be making any changes: we are comfortable with the level of security provided by the Android OS. – On the iOS side the team is exploring the possibility of moving the access token storage to the keychain in order to comply with best practices.” Facebook replied to MetaIntell after vulnerability report.
