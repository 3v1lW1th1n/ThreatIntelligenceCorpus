Software Updates Used as Phishing Bait
Phishers have been targeting software updates to distribute malicious software (malware). In the example below, the phisher sent the email from a spoofed Microsoft account to a Cyveillance email address, prompting the user to click on the update link in the body of the message. The link itself appears to be a legitimate Microsoft update site (update.microsoft.com). However, the link is actually obfuscated and when clicked, routes the user to a malicious Website infected with malware.
While attacks such as the one above are not new, it is only recently that this method has truly become a mainstream vector. It is likely that we will continue to see more of this type of attacks in the future.
Clicking on links within emails presents potential danger to users. Cyveillance recommends only updating software from the update feature within the application or actually downloading the update from the software vendorâ€™s Website.
