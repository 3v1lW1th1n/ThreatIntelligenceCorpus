Weekly Phishing Report – October 26, 2015
Week of October 18 – October 24, 2015
Author: Robert McDaniel

In this week’s phishing activity report, we again saw a negligible increase in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Transportation (>75%) and eCommerce (>45%) saw increases in phishing activity last week.  Drops in Internet Software & Services (>45%) and Computer Hardware (>30%) phishing attempts helped counteract the increases in the aforementioned industries.

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
