12 Flaws Fixed in Google Chrome
Google has fixed 12 security vulnerabilities in Chrome, including six high-risk bugs. The new version of the browser includes a number of fixes for bugs discovered by external researchers as well as by Google’s own internal security team.
Two of the more serious vulnerabilities patched in Chrome include use-after-free bugs in various elements of the browser, and there also are two out of bounds reads in the browser. Those are listed as high-risk flaws, as well. But perhaps the most interesting bug fixed in the new version is a medium-risk vulnerability related to the TLS negotiation process. During that process, Chrome failed to do a check of some certificates it encountered.
Here’s the full list of bugs fixed Chrome 31:
