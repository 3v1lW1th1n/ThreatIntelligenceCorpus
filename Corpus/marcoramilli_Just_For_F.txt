Just For Fun, not Yet Security


Hi Folks, I'm still roadtripping US. Actually I am in Oklahoma City and I'm writing from an Internet Caffe in downtown passing through a secure SSL Proxy.I don't have enough time to write about security stuff BUT,  2 days ago I received a nice email from a friend of mine containing  these funny pictures. I wanna share it to you.I'm not sure they well represent the difference between Mic and Mac guys, anyway they're funny.
