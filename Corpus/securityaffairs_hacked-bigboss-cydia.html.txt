“The website and companion repo are using Saurik’s recent “Competition vs Community” as a motivation for their acts,” iDownloadBlog reports, but security experts are skeptical. I strongly suggest you to avoid the ripBigBoss repo, despite Kim Jong-Cracks announced that all the apps published are not infected. I remind you that it is quite easy for hackers to trojanize  legitimate applications initially present in the BigBoss store.
