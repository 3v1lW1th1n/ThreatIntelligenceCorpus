Inside the world of the Brazilian carding scene
Last week at #TheSAS2018, I had a chance to sit down with Thiago Marques and Santiago Pontiroli of Kaspersky Labâ€™s Latin American GReAT (Global Research & Analysis Team) to discuss their presentation. During our 10-minute conversation, we took a look at two main aspects of their presentation.
One part of the talk focused on how point-of-sale malware is able to steal credit card credentials. The second part was about the prevalence of the marketplace for buying and selling stolen credit card credentials in Brazil.
During the chat, we also touch on what consumers can do to protect themselves from this type of scam as well as if we can expect to see this type of attack to expand beyond Brazil.
