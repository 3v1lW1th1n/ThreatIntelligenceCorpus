The italian Answer to Cybersecurity Agency


Hi folks,today I wanna show you CNAIPIC (Centro Nazionale Anticrimine Informatico per la Protezione delle Infrastrutture Critiche): the italian's answer to CyberSecurity Terrorism. I'm glad that Italy is sensible to these problems, too many times people tends to forget how it's important Computer Security or, let me say "Internet Security". Having some "police experts"  who try to investigate online it's a really useful service for each citizen. Actually I've just some doubts (maybe questions) about who will teach the "security police experts" what is Computer Security ?
