2016 Stat: 75% of ransomware comes from Russian-speaking criminal underground
The annual RSA conference will often overwhelm the average attendee. Between the great talks, the exhibition hall, the parties, and the city of San Francisco itself, there is a whole lot to take in.
It typically takes some time for the talks to really pick up and build up steam to drop a fact that makes you say…wow or damn. However, this year, it took me all of six hours from landing in the city from frigid Boston.
While sitting in the RSAC 2017 Ransomware Summit, I was floored when I heard Anton Ivanov, a senior malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, drop the following tidbit.
Out of the 62 crypto ransomware families discovered by the company’s researchers in the past year, 47 of them were developed by Russian-speaking cybercriminals — that’s a whopping 75%. What makes that figure even more staggering is that these ransomware families according to Kaspersky Lab telemetry attacked more than 1.4 million people around the globe in 2016.

Over the course of his talk, Anton delved into the research that the team conducted, breaking down the aspects of criminal involvement with ransomware (outside of the whole ransomware-being-a-crime thing).
The structure of a professional ransomware group contains the malware writer, affiliate program owners, partners of the program, and the manager who connects them all into one invisible enterprise
What really stood out to me on this was, if we know so much about this type of crime, why do we still see it? As Ivanov notes, it really comes down to the money and barriers to entry into this business. If you are interested in a more technical read on this, I suggest hopping over to Securelist, where this research was broken out more thoroughly.
If you think about it, this talk and topic was quite fitting to sit in on given that this city once housed some bad dudes in an isolated prison in the Bay.
