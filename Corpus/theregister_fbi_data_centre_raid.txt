FBI fat-thumbs data centre raid
A bungled FBI raid on a data centre has taken out an unknown number of Web sites.
Apparently targeting a particular – but unnamed – customer of DigitalOne, the G-men seized three enclosures of equipment, according to the New York Times.
Among the collateral damage is New York publisher the Curbed Network, and the Pinboard bookmarking site, which is now operating from a backup server. Pinboard has been unable to confirm whether or not its machines were among those lifted by the FBI, only that its main database server is offline and that it’s running with reduced capabilities.
And while the FBI hasn’t commented on the NYT story, it appears there’s a lock-out at the server farm, with DigitalOne complaining that it is unable to check which servers were taken, can’t restart its own servers, and isn’t sure when its support system will be back online.
While the story doesn’t nominate which of DigitalOne’s data centres was targeted, its 285,000-square-foot CoreSite facility was located in Reston, North Virginia, and promoted under the slogan “Your Data in a Safe Place”. An FBI holding facility is also a safe place, but regrettably for DigitalOne’s customers, it’s not an accessible place. ®
