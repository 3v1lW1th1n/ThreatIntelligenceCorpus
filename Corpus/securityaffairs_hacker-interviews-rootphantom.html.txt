You are a talented hacker that has already participated in several hacking campaigns, could you tell me more about.
We did shut down the PSN and Xbox services last year.
Could you tell me which his your technical background and when you started hacking? Which are your motivations?
In 2014, I started hacking, My background is PHP, python, Perl, c++, HTML, and exploiting. My first motivation is to be a member of one of the most dreaded hacker team, I’m board, second, I like hacking.
What was your greatest hacking challenge? Which was your latest hack? Can you describe me it?
I have no specific hacking challenge. My newest hack was the hack of a website that was hosting credit cards, but without a proper security. Finally, I did it, I hacked it like black hats do.
What are the 4 tools that cannot be missed in the hacker’s arsenal and why?
Which are the most interesting hacking communities on the web today, why?
Leakedsource: to find all leaks. HackForums where hackers and people go to learn hacking.
Did you participate in hacking attacks against the IS propaganda online? When? How?
No, I haven’t participated to any ISIS hunting neither hacker their websites.
Where do you find IS people to hack? How do you choose your targets?
But you can find them on the dark/deep web or on twitter. If you go to @tool_binary they do a great job of find them.
We often hear about cyber weapons and cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. Do you believe it is real the risk of a major and lethal cyber attack against a critical infrastructure?  
Cyber security is a myth. Most nations already use cyber weapons like EMP. I know that the U.S.A is training Navy Seal to fight in the cyberspace, they are working on the creation of cyber weapons too.
