6 Ways to Hack PostgresSQL Login

In this article, we will learn how to gain control over our victim’s PC through 5432 Port use for Postgres service. There are various ways to do it and let take time and learn all those because different circumstances call for different measure.
 Let’s starts!!
Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, postgres, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more
Now, we need to choose a wordlist. As with any dictionary attack, the wordlist is key. Kali has numerous wordlists built right in.
Run the following command
 hydra –L/root/Desktop/user.txt –P /root/Desktop/pass.txt 192.168.1.120 postgres 
-L: denotes path for username list
-P:  denotes path for password list
Once the commands are executed it will start applying the dictionary attack and so you will have the right username and password in no time. As you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the postgres username as postgres and password as postgres.

This is the graphical version to apply dictionary attack via 5432 port to hack a system. For this method to work:
Open xHydra in your kali. And select Single Target option and their give the IP of your victim PC. And select postgres in box against Protocol option and give the port number 5432 against the port option.

Now, go to Passwords tab and select Username List and give the path of your text file, which contains usernames, in the box adjacent to it.
Then select Password List and give the path of your text file, which contains all the passwords, in the box adjacent to it.

After doing this, go to Start tab and click on Start button on the left.
Now, the process of dictionary attack will start. Thus, you will attain the username and password of your victim.

Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer. It supports many protocols: AFP, CVS, POSTGRES, HTTP, IMAP, rlogin, SSH, Subversion, and VNC to name a few
Run the following command
Medusa  -h 192.168.1.120 –U /root/Desktop/user.txt –P /root/Desktop/pass.txt –M postgres
Here 
-U: denotes path for username list
-P:  denotes path for password list
As you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the postgres username as postgres and password as postgres.

Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. 
Run the following command
ncrack –v –U /root/Desktop/user.txt–P /root/Desktop/pass.txt 192.168.1.120:5432
 Here 
-U: denotes path for username list
-P:  denotes path for password list
As you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the postgres username as postgres and password as postgres.

 Patator is a multi-purpose brute-forcer, with a modular design and a flexible usage. It is quite useful for making brute force attack on several ports such as POSTGRES, HTTP, SMB and etc.
patator pgsql_login host=192.168.1.120 user=FILE0 0=/root/Desktop/user.txt password=FILE1 1=/root/Desktop/pass.txt 

From given below image you can observe that the process of dictionary attack starts and thus, you will attain the username and password of your victim.

This module attempts to authenticate against a PostgreSQL instance using username and password combinations indicated by the USER_FILE, PASS_FILE, and USERPASS_FILE options. Note that passwords may be either plaintext or MD5 formatted hashes.
Open Kali terminal type msfconsole
 Now type use auxiliary/scanner/postgres/postgres_login
msf exploit (scanner/postgres/postgres_login)>set rhosts 192.168.1.120 (IP of Remote Host)
msf exploit (scanner/postgres/postgres_login)>set user_file  /root/Desktop/user.txt
msf exploit (scanner/postgres/postgres_login)>set userpass_file  /root/Desktop/pass.txt
msf exploit (scanner/postgres/postgres_login)>set stop_on_success true
msf exploit (scanner/postgres/postgres_login)> exploit
 From given below image you can observe that we had successfully grabbed the POSTGRES username and password.
