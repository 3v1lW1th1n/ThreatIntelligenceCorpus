Anti-virus products are rubbish, says Imperva
A study released in December by US security outfit Imperva has tipped a bucket on the multi-billion-dollar anti-virus industry, claiming that initial detection rates are as low as five percent, and concluding that enterprise and consumer anti-virus spend “is not proportional to its effectiveness”.
Working in conjunction with students from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, the company tested 82 malware samples against 40 anti-virus products including offerings from Microsoft, Symantec, McAfee and Kaspersky.
The test revealed that while catalogued viruses are well-detected, “less than 5% of anti-virus solutions in the study were able to initially detect previously non-cataloged viruses and that many solutions took up to a month or longer following the initial scan to update their signatures.”
Interestingly, the study revealed that virus writers improve their chance of evading detection by keeping a low profile. If an infection is spreading rapidly, it provides a large number of identical samples that feed into the anti-virus detection databases.
On the other hand, “variants that are of limited distribution (such as government sponsored attacks) usually leave a large window of opportunity”, the study states. That window of opportunity gives security teams a “blind spot”: if a zero-day virus gets past the first line of defense, security teams might not notice the infection until it’s become a crisis.
While stating that it does not advocate abandoning anti-virus products, Imperva suggests enterprise security should devote more attention to detecting aberrant behavior in systems and servers. Which, unsurprisingly, happens to be the company’s own specialty.
