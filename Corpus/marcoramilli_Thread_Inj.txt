Thread Injection




Today I suggest this short but intensive ( :D ) reading. It's a simple tutorial for thread injection in x86 systems. I believe it is useful for everybody likes thread hijacking . It shortly describes 7 simple steps to attack a generic running process Â by showing code examples to make the reading even faster.

Here the seven main steps:



Detect the target process
Identify the main thread
Suspend the main thread
Obtain the thread content
Create the "code-cave" (the code to be injected)
Spoof the %IP and hijacking control flow
Resume the thread, continue execution and free the memory
