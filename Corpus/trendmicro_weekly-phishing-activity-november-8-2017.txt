Weekly Phishing Activity: November 8, 2017

This week, we saw an increase in overall phishing activity – over 20 percent – for the top 20 brands we monitor.
 
 
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
