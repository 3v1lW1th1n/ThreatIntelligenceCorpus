Quiz: Metal band or cyberthreat?
We love cybersecurity and find it fascinating. Cybercriminals invent new ways to attack victims daily, and we counter them with tools to protect people. It’s a game of cat-and-mouse, but with much higher stakes.
Some of us also love metal music. Its energy helps us maintain the drive, the joy, and, sometimes, the anger that we need to fight those crooks. So it’s probably not a coincidence that some malware species or other cybersecurity-related things have names that could suit a metal band.
