How GDPR will affect your business
So, General Data Protection Regulation aka GDPR is just around the corner (well, 2018) and a lot of companies are only beginning to get a grasp of what the new EU ruling will mean for their business.
But, whilst a lot of IT departments are running around like headless chickens, frantic to ensure compliancy, did you stop to think how other departments might be affected?
You see, GDPR affects more than just IT. In fact, any department that touches or uses customer data (and let’s face it, which department doesn’t these days) will have to ensure compliancy.
So, to that end, Kaspersky Lab commissioned a report to look at how different internal departments inside most businesses feel about GDPR. The findings make interesting reading.
According to the report, 67% of those polled are concerned about personal data being hacked or breached, with a further 55% of correspondence saying they feel that their own personal data would be looked after securely.
Another telling statistic is that 50% of businesses feel they’re prepared for GDPR. The other half of those polled don’t feel ready for GDPR. That’s a hugely concerning number, considering just how important it is.
