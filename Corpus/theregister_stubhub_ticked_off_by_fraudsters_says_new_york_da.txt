StubHub hit by trans-Atlantic fraudsters, says New York DA
eBay's ticket-selling offshoot StubHub has admitted to a breach of some users' security by a ring of fraudsters.
Reuters and AP have both received notification from New York district attorney Cyrus Vance of an event to be staged on Wednesday morning US time, at which the details of the attack will be revealed.
Arrests in at least three nations will apparently be revealed.
StubHub admits that around 1,000 accounts were compromised, through attacks on account-holders rather than core systems.
The result of the breach is said to be co-ordinated fraud across at least three nations.
Investigations into the incident are said to have gone on for up to one year.
StubHub allows those who hold tickets to events sporting contests or concerts to resell unwanted tickets. The site is used by, among others, ticket brokers who have excess inventory they wish to offload. At a guess, that kind of operator is a more tempting target for fraudsters than an individual with a spare ticket to offload, and also more likely to operate across three countries.
We'll know more about just what went on tomorrow. ®
