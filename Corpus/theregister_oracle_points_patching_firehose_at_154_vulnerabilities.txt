Oracle points patching firehose at 154 vulnerabilities
Sysadmins forced by circumstance or folly to support Java can get busy again, with 25 fixes for the product among the Scarlet Letter's regular patch notice.
The good news is that Oracle says none of the vulnerabilities in its mammoth bug-splat had been exploited as of 19 October.
The fixes to Java SE and Java SE Embedded cover vulnerabilities in the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture), Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI), Java FX, serialisation, 2D, Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), Java Generic Security Services (JGSS), security and deployment sub-components, as well as various library flaws.
Over at the Big O's security blog, regular bearer-of-bad-news Eric Maurice lists “Oracle database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Hyperion, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Supply Chain Products Suite, Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise, Oracle Siebel CRM, Oracle Industry Applications, including Oracle Communications Applications and Oracle Retail Applications, Oracle Java SE, Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite, Oracle Pillar Axiom, Oracle Linux & Virtualization, and Oracle MySQL” as getting fixes.
Of the Java SE fixes, he writes, 20 apply only to Java in the browser, the remaining five apply to both client and server Java SE, and 24 are remotely exploitable without authentication. Hooray.
There are eight fixes for the Oracle database, one of which (CVE-2015-4863, not yet described on Mitre) has a base score of 10, because it's remotely exploitable without authentication.
There's also a perfect 10 in Oracle Sun Systems' Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM), and Maurice says as well as patching ILOM, sysadmins should block outside access to the software.
The full name-and-shame list is here. ®
