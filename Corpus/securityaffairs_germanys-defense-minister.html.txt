					Germany’s defense minister: Cyber security is going to be the main focus of this decade.					
The cybersecurity is a pillar of modern states, the string of recent massive attacks including NotPetya and WannaCry is the demonstration that we are all potential targets.
Cyber attacks could hit governments, private companies and citizens in every time and from every where causing severe problems to the victims and huge financial losses. The cyber risk is directly linked to geopolitical, environmental, technological, and economic risks. A cyber attack could destabilize governments worldwide, it can get a business out of the business.
When journalists asked about the “single greatest threat to global stability,” to the German defense minister, she confirmed the disconcerting scenario.
“I think it’s the cyber threats because whatever adversaries you can think of and even if you talk about Daesh (the terrorist group) they use the cyber domain to fight against us.” Germany’s defense minister Ursula von der Leyen told CNBC.
