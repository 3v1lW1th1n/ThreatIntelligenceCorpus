July Patch Tuesday: Large Adobe Security Update and Patches for 18 Critical Microsoft Vulnerabilities
July’s Patch Tuesday addresses 53 vulnerabilities, including 18 critical ones, most of which involve Microsoft’s browsers. These include CVE-2018-8280, CVE-2018-8286, CVE-2018-8290, CVE-2018-8294, and CVE-2018-8298, all of which are corruption bugs in the Chakra Javascript Engine that exist in the way it handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge. An attacker could then use a specially crafted website that could potentially provide administrative rights to the perpetrator.
CVE-2018-8304, a Windows DNSAPI Denial of Service Vulnerability, is another noteworthy vulnerability addressed this month. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability could cause the shutdown of a DNS server, which could disrupt an organization’s operations. However, this vulnerability does not allow attackers to execute code or change user privileges.
