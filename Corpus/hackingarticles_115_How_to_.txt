How to Detect Sniffer on Your Network

Xarp is an advanced anti spoofing tool that flags all the spoofing attacks that might be using ARP(address resolution protocol) targeting your system. This includes documents, emails and VoiceIP conversations.  ARP attacks allows hacker to manipulate the data sent over the network. Xarp uses active and passive modules to detect hackers inside the network. Having such tools in the system is very important as the computer firewalls and OS security do not provide protection against ARP attacks.
