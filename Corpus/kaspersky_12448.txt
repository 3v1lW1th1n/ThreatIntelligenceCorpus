We’ve got your cam covered — no duct tape required
The surest way to prevent your webcam from transmitting images or video is to cover its lens. Lots of security-minded folks do just that, having read scary stories about malware enabling creeps to spy on them through their built-in or connected webcam.

But people who actually use their cameras — for personal calls, work videoconferencing, or any other reason — may not want to block the camera with duct tape, or stickers, or whatnot. And many others will forget, at least occasionally, to replace the tape after using the camera.
Our flagship security solutions — Kaspersky Internet Security and Kaspersky Total Security — can help protect your privacy in a variety of ways including not allowing your webcam to serve as a spying device. Kaspersky Webcam Protection feature is available in both the PC and the Mac versions of our products.
