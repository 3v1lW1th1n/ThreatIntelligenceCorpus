Insurance/Healthcare
“A dozen health care insurance firms that cover 60 percent of the U.S. population took part in CyberRX 2.0, a cyber exercise aimed at evaluating the organizations’ response and minimizing the impact of a data breach, participants said on Dec. 4.The exercise simulated an attack that attempted to profit from the submission of forged health care claims and to steal personal health information. Both the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) and Deloitte Advisory Cyber Risk Services managed the exercise, pushing new information—or “injects”—to the more than 250 participating professionals.”

Financial Services
“Many of the 65,000 ATMs in the UK will become less secure once Microsoft ends extended support for the embedded version of its Windows XP operating system next month, according to security experts. From January 2016, Microsoft will be issuing no further security patches or updates for flavours of Windows still used by the majority of ATMs in the UK (and in many other countries around the world). Support has already been wound down but next year it will be discontinued unless banks upgrade or bridge the gap with expensive custom support contracts.”

Legal and Regulations
“Negotiators of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed on the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity. […] It is a priority for the Commission to help prevent these incidents, and in case they occur, provide the most efficient response. This is why the Commission put forward in 2013 a proposal for a Directive to ensure a high common level of network and information security (NIS) in the EU.”

Retail
“On any given day, there are thousands of gift cards from top retailers for sale online that can be had for a fraction of their face value. Some of these are exactly what they appear to be: legitimate gift cards sold through third-party sites that specialize in reselling used or unwanted cards. But many of the more steeply discounted gift cards for sale online are in fact the product of merchandise return fraud, meaning consumers who purchase them unwittingly help thieves rob the stores that issued the cards.”

Technology
“Facebook, Google and Twitter are stepping up efforts to combat online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants, but the Internet companies are doing it quietly to avoid the perception that they are helping the authorities police the Web. […] The Internet companies described their policies as straightforward: they ban certain types of content in accordance with their own terms of service, and require court orders to remove or block anything beyond that. Anyone can report, or flag, content for review and possible removal.”

Law Enforcement
“Encrypted communications are increasingly thwarting intelligence agencies that are working to detect terrorist activity. And a comment Wednesday from the FBI’s director emphasizes how serious the issue has become. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey said encryption is a “big problem” that the US must grapple with, especially in light of recent ISIS-linked terror attacks that have hit Europe and the US.”

Defense
“A computer program, funded in large part by the U.S. military, has displayed the ability to learn and generate new ideas as quickly and accurately as can a human. While the scope of the research was limited to understanding handwritten characters, the breakthrough could have big consequences for military’s ability to collect, analyze and act on image data, according to the researchers and military scientists. That, in turn, could lead to far more capable drones, far faster intelligence collection, and far swifter targeting through artificial intelligence.”
