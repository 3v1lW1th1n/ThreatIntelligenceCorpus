					The economic impact of cybercrime will reach $8 Trillion by 2022					
According to a report published by Juniper Research, the number of data records that will be compromised in security breaches in 2017 will reach 2.8 billion.
Small-and mid-size businesses (SMBs) are more exposed to cyber attacks, these organizations will reserve an average of under $4,000 a year in 2017 on cyber security expenses. Unfortunately, experts believe that companies will not increase their security budget despite rising threats.
Patch management, low level of awareness on cyber threat, and usage of older software are the principal problems in the way SMBs approach the cyber security.
The full Juniper Research report includes a lot of interesting data, unfortunately, it isn’t for free.
