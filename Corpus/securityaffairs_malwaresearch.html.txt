					Malwaresearch – A command line tool to find malware on Openmalware.org					
The tool was developed to facilitate and speed up the process of finding and downloading malware samples via the command line interface.
We’ve made use of the API provided by the two major malware dump sites (openmalware.org and malwr.com) in a script that’s simple and pretty straightforward, which allows users to query information pertaining to malware, such as: Name, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, download the desired malware sample file, and even compare its digital signature (hash) with the ones present in the dumps in question.
Our next mission is to pull off the same deed, this time, however, using malwr.com, MalShare, MalwareBlacklist, Malware.lu’s AVCaesar from command line malware samples submission, to hash comparison and research.
