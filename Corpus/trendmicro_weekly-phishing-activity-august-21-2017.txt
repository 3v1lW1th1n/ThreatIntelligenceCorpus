Weekly Phishing Activity: August 21, 2017

This week, we saw a >40% decrease in overall phishing activity from the top 20 brands we monitor. The industries with the greatest decreases in phishing activity included Internet Search & Navigation Services (>75%), Storage and Systems Management Software (>75%), and Internet and Information Services (>65%).
Industries with the greatest increases were: Social Networks (>20%), Banking (>20%), and Electronic Payment Systems (>10%).
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
