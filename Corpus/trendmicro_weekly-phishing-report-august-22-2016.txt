Weekly Phishing Report: August 22, 2016
Week of August 14 – August 20, 2016

Internet Search & Navigation services along with the Storage & System Mgmt Software and Banking industry are the top 3 phishing targets this week.
In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >10% increase in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Email Providers (>50%), Storage & Systems Management Software (>25%), and eCommerce (>25%) saw the biggest increases in activity. We only saw a decrease in phishing activity in one industry for the top 20 brands we’re tracking – Electronic Payment Systems (>20%).
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
