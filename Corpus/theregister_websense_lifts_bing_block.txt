Websense blocks Bing in IM snafu
Websense users were temporarily blocked from enjoying the launch of Microsoft's Bing search engine on Monday.
Similarities between the Bing domain and that used by a Microsoft IM app - rather than the ready availability of porn through the new search decision engine - were behind the temporary roadblock.

Websense has now reclassified the site to allow surfers in corporates who restrict IM apps unfettered access to Microsoft's revamped response to Google, as a statement from Websense explains:
This has now been changed and is categorized as ‘Search Engine and Portals’ for Websense customers and ‘Search Engines’ for SurfControl filtering customers. Websense customers that have downloaded the latest URL database will already see the updated classification. SurfControl customers who download the latest database will see the change today [Tuesday].
Bing would of course be a great name for an instant message app for New Jersey wiseguys. The previous use of the site as an MSN IM domain seems like a placeholder ahead of the launch of Bing this week. ®
Thanks to Reg reader Tim H for the heads up. "Maybe Microsoft should have told web security firms that all live.com searches would be forwarded to bing.com," he told us on Monday.
