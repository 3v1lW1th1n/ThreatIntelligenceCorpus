Claudio Guarnieri on Security Without Borders
Security researcher and activist Claudio Guarnieri talks to Mike Mimoso about a new project announced last week at the Chaos Communication Congress called Security Without Borders. The project aims to form a collective of researchers and security practitioners who volunteer to provide pen-testing, incident response and other services to people living in repressed parts of the world in need of such help. The project is also a call to action to hackers to reach out to those in civil society in need of security and privacy services.
