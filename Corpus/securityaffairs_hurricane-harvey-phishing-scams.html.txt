The US CERT is warning of Potential Hurricane Harvey phishing scams, the experts fear crooks may start using malicious emails purportedly tied to the storm.
US-CERT is advising users to remain vigilant when receiving unsolicited emails with attachments or links purporting to be related to the Hurricane Harvey that recently hit the Texas killing at least five people and injuring a dozen of people over the weekend.
US experts warn of phishing emails requesting donations from allegedly charity organizations, a tactic observed after other major disasters and incidents.
Typically these messages used malicious attachments or embed links to websites hosting exploits or to phishing pages.
A good practice to avoid scams is to contact the charity organizations by calling them directly.
US-CERT encourages users and administrators to use caution receiving messages linked to the Hurricane Harvey and adopt the following best practices:
Cyber criminals have no scruples and often exploit any tragic event in their favor.
In October, as the Hurricane Matthew was battering the South Carolina coast, authorities warned of a series of cyber attacks against residents.
In the past crooks exploited the media interest in tragic events like the Boston Marathon attack and the crash of the flight MH17 of Malaysian Airline, they used the news as bait themes for massive spam attacks and spear phishing campaigns.
