A team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and engineers at Facebook have designed a detection technique for man-in-the-middle attacks over SSL on a large-scale. They analyzed the data extracting useful information, including the data related to digital certificates presented, about the methods used the attacks.
The researchers analyzed nearly 3.5 million SSL connections made to Facebook during a four-month period started in December 2013. They discovered that 6,845, corresponding to 0.2 percent of all connections used fake SSL certificates with the intent to syphon data. This data is just related to Facebook, this means that something quite similar is happening for connections to other popular websites.
It is a common practice of cyber criminal ecosystem to use fake SSL certificates for bogus websites impersonating legitimate web services like e-commerce, payment platform and social networks. The attackers usually use self-signed digital certificates or stolen certificate that is accepted as valid by most browsers.
 
The paper suggests different mitigations methods that browser vendors could implement to mitigate the cyber threat, including the adoption of HTTP Strict Transport Security, Public Key Pinning, TLS Origin Bound Certificates, and the validation of certificates with notaries.
“Our data suggest that browsers could possibly detect many of the forged certificates based on size characteristics, such as checking whether the certificate chain depth is larger than one,” the report said. “We strongly encourage popular websites, as well as mobile applications, to deploy similar mechanisms to start detecting SSL interception.”
