NBN opens 400 tech jobs in looming second Melbourne security shop
nbn, the company building Australia's national broadband network (NBN), will hire 400 tech bods over the next two years to staff its upcoming Cyber Security Operations Centre in Melbourne's south.
The will operate around the clock with infosec bods policing the network.
It will operate in addition to the Network and Services Operations Centre also in Melbourne's Docklands adding to the state's pool of 2300 NBN workers.
Vulture South has asked nbn to explain the skills it value in applicants and the roles it hopes to fill. The organisation already has some talented long-time security boffins in its ranks but will be competing for much-sought after talent in an industry where experienced hackers can nearly write their own pay cheques.
An additional 300 construction jobs will be created over the next "several years".
The cost of the centre has not been disclosed.
Federal Communications Minister Mitch Fifield says the centre will be the "front line for defending the NBN against cyber-attack".
"In coming years, millions of Australians will be reliant on the NBN, so it is vital that continued cyber security for this important infrastructure is protected and in place at all times," Minister Fifield says .
"Highly skilled technical specialists will be employed at the new 24-hour facility and additional roles will be created in specialised ICT and engineering, as well as technical support and administration."
Some 4500 jobs will be created to bring the NBN in some patchwork form to completion by 2020. Those jobs include 1300 in New South Wales, 900 in Western Australia and Queensland, 800 in Victoria, 400 in South Australia, and 200 in Tasmania.
It is spending about A$40 million (£19.4 million) over the next four years to train up its workforce. ®
