Two years ago I started Security Affairs for joke motivated by my passion in the security, day after day it is growing thanks to your affection and your precious support.
I wish you were all here to hug you and have a coffee together, the Italians love coffee ðŸ˜‰ â€¦ Maybe one day we will.
The community is growing, your suggestions are precious for me, I do all the best despite Iâ€™m the unique person behind Security Affairs.
During this exciting adventure I met a lot of good friends and great professional that I desire to thank.
Andrey Komarov, Anthony M. Freed, Bill Hagestad, David DeWalt, Domenico Dominoni, Gary S. Miliefsky, Laura QuiÃ±ones Urquiza, Marco Don Francesco, Mohit Kumar, Niels Groeneveld, Paul C Dwyer, Raoul Chiesa, Richard Amores, Richard Stiennon, Robert Rodriguez â€¦
And thank you of course!
