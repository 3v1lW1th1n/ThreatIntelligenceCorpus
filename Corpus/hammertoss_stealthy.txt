HAMMERTOSS: Stealthy Tactics Define a Russian Cybe...

HAMMERTOSS: Stealthy Tactics Define a Russian Cyber Threat Group
 
 
The Russian threat groups that we monitor frequently cover their
  tracks to evade detection. One of these groups, APT29, has been
  particularly active throughout 2015, redoubling its efforts with new
  downloaders, payloads, and targets. Several of our colleagues in the
  security industry[1] have published research
  exposing some of APT29’s recent activities.
In early 2015, we came across a backdoor, HAMMERTOSS, which is
    similarly designed to make it difficult for security
  professionals to detect and characterize the extent of APT29’s
  activity. The developers of HAMMERTOSS try to avoid detection by
  adding layers of obfuscation and mimicking the behavior of legitimate
  users. HAMMERTOSS does this by using several commonly visited
  websites—Twitter, GitHub, and cloud storage services—to relay commands
  and extract data from victims.  
HAMMERTOSS works by:
 Retrieving commands via legitimate web services, such as
    Twitter and GitHub, or using compromised web servers for command and
    control (CnC), Visiting different Twitter handles daily and
  automatically, Using timed starts—communicating only after a
    specific date or only during the victim’s workweek,
Obtaining commands via images containing hidden and encrypted
    data, and Extracting information from a compromised network
    and uploading files to cloud storage services.

    and uploading files to cloud storage services.
APT29 is among the most capable groups that we track. While other
  APT groups try to cover their tracks to thwart investigators, APT29
  stands out. They show discipline and consistency in reducing or
  eliminating forensic evidence, as well as adaptability in monitoring
  and circumventing network defenders’ remediation efforts. In our
  report, we describe how HAMMERTOSS functions and how it demonstrates
  APT29’s capabilities.
FireEye products/services identify this activity as HAMMERTOSS
  within the user interfaces.
The complete
    report can be downloaded here.
FireEye is hosting a HAMMERTOSS
    webinar on August 25 with threat intelligence analysts, who will
  discuss the five stages of HAMMERTOSS, who APT29 is, and why this
  malware is so difficult to detect.
