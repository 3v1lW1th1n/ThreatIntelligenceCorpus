Brazil whacks PRISM with secure email plan
A week after joining a consortium calling for the USA's currently cold, dead, fingers to be pried off the internet's internal machinery, Brazil has announced that it will develop a secure e-mail system to try and protect its government-level communications against American spying.
The nation's President Dilma Rousseff used the secure messaging channel Twitter to make the announcement that she's going to order SERPRO – that country's federal data processing service – to implement a whole-of-government secure e-mail system.
A series of three Tweets depicted below said the Brazilian government needs “more security on our messages to prevent possible espionage”. The agency given the task is also responsible for developing systems for secure online tax returns, and issues passports.
Rouseff has already condemned the USA and Canada for allegedly spying against Brazilian government agencies.
Last week, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Society joined with all five regional address registries decided that ICANN and IANA functions should be globalised (which only a short while ago was the kind of suggestion that drew forth good Americans to scream about an ITU “takeover”).
ICANN president and CEO Fadi Chehadé met with Rousseff after the Montevideo meeting that issued the 'net's globalisation manifesto, apparently to seek her cooperation in internationalising Internet governance. ®
