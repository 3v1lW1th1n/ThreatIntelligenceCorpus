EMC and VMware both suffer malicious user access messes
VMware and EMC have each revealed security nasties.
EMC's problem is with Data Domain OS, the operating system for its disk backup boxen.
AS EMC's notification explains, “Data Domain logs the session identifier of a user logged in via the GUI in a file that is accessible to all users.”
All users? D'oh! That means “A malicious user could use the disclosed session identifier to take over the account of the victim, a GUI user whose session identifier was disclosed.” Which means a low-level storage admin could log in as their boss. And then fool with data the boss doesn't want everyone to have rights to fool with. There's an upgrade for Data Domain OS 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 here for you to implement. Because all storage admins have time for that sort of thing.
VMware's problems start with VMSA-2016-0007, a “critical input validation vulnerability” that “may allow a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information” in its NSX software-defined networking product and the vCNS security product. Patches for NSX Edge 6.1 and 6.2, plus vCNS Edge 5.5, are already available here and here.
Virtzilla's also warning of VMSA-2016-0008, a moderate VMware vRealize Log Insight “that may allow for a stored cross-site scripting attack” and “may lead to the hijack of an authenticated user's session.” Versions 2.x and 3.x need to visit this page for patches. ®
