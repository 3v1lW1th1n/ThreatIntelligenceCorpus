Malware experts at IBM’s X-Force have spotted a new strain of the Rovnix malware targeting the Japanese bank customers. The new threat comes from Russia and it is very sophisticated. According to the IBM’s X-Force it is able to evade the vast majority of antivirus solutions.
This malware is the last one of series of threat that is targeting the Japanese Banking industry, Brolux Trojan, Shifu, Tsukuba, and Neverquest are the malicious code that are threatening the Japanese banking  customers.
“IBM X-Force researchers have discovered that the cybercrime gang operating the Rovnix Trojan has launched an aggressive new infection campaign in Japan.” states the IBM’s X-Force.
Rovnix is considered a serious threat to the banking industry, IBM X-Force data show that it is one of the most popular malware worldwide.

 
Threat actors used high-quality crafted Japanese-language emails that include ZIP files containing fake invoices, and the Rovnix, a crimeware kit very popular in the criminal underground.
The Zip files seemingly coming from .ru domains (Russia), when victims open an invoice it triggers the malware’s execution. The malicious code is able to inject JavaScript into the login form used by 14 Japanese banks. The code is used by attackers to launch a man-in-the-middle attack while users are trying to access their bank accounts, the scripts are also able to defeat two-factor authentication.
“The injection mechanism used by Rovnix is a commercial offering that was sold to cybercriminals in the underground by a developer who specializes in creating injections that perfectly mimic the look and feel of the targeted bank’s Web pages. They even adapt the flow of events to the target’s authentication scheme. The webinjections facilitate the display of social engineering content on the bank’s Web pages as viewed from the infected user’s browser. For each bank, the injections used by Rovnix modify large parts of the original page, which is designed to trick the victim into divulging the second password or token for the ensuing fraudulent transaction.” continues IBM.
In some cases, the experts discovered the Rovnix providing instructions for the victims to download an Android app onto a mobile device. That malicious app contains the Rovnix component for SMS hijacking which listens for incoming SMS messages containing transaction authorization codes from the bank.
Experts believe that Japanese financial sector is under attack and will suffer many similar attacks in the next months.
“Starting in the summer of 2015, Japan began seeing some of the world’s most sophisticated banking Trojans attack banks in the country. From Japan-focused codes such as Tsukuba to the highly modular Shifu and now Rovnix, it is clear that the Japanese financial sector is under attack. It is now recognized as a lucrative target to cybercriminals from Japan and Eastern Europe.”
