Objective-C can fly the COOP, says subversive at Microsoft Research
Objective-C programmers should use message authentication codes to protect sensitive objects and data structures, according to research presented to this week's Usenix Annual Technical Conference (ATC).
A Microsoft Research staffer, and software researchers from UC Irving in America and folks in Germany focused on a technique called counterfeit object-oriented programming (COOP), which has already been demonstrated as a way to attack C++ programs but not Objective-C.
As they explain in this paper, their discovery opens the door to “COOP-style exploits” in programs running on both OS X and iOS.
Their “Subversive-C” exploits work by “carefully arranging the metadata used to dispatch messages in the Objective-C runtime”, they write, and aren't caught by existing randomisation-based defences.
The paper uses Apple's AppKit library from Cocoa, because it's popular as the basis for UIs in applications like iTunes, Safari, Pages, Keynote and more.
The proof-of-concept demonstrates that Subversive-C exploits don't need many bugs in a AppKit program to take over the target:
Their suggested mitigation is that message authentication codes (MACs) can be added to sensitive fields and data structures. This would mean attackers couldn't alter Objective-C data structures unless they also know how to update the MAC with the right values – and that would require access to the MACs' key store.
Even in the overweight iTunes, the researchers say, providing this kind of protection only imposes a startup overhead of half a second.
A good background on the COOP class of attacks is here. ®
