					The controversial certificate authority StartCom will go out of business on January 1, 2018					
The controversial certificate authority StartCom is going to close, according to board chairman Xiaosheng Tan, the business will end its activity on January 1, 2018.
Starting from January 1, 2018, StartCom will no longer issue new digital certificates, but CRL and OCSP service will continue for two years, until the expiration of the StartCom’s three key root pairs.

For this reason, according to Tan the shut down of the CA “would not have a major impact.”
According to w3techs.com, about 0.1 per cent of websites worldwide still use StartCom as an SSL certificate authority.
The following diagram shows the historical trend in the percentage of websites using StartCom.
