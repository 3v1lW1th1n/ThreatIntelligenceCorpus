					Multiple models of IP-based cameras from Chinese firm Foscam could be easily hacked. Update the firmware now!					
The Chinese firm Foscam has released firmware updates to address three vulnerabilities in multiple models of IP-based cameras that could be exploited to take control of vulnerable cameras exposed online.
The following flaws were reported by the experts from IoT security firm VDOO:
chaining the three flaw the hackers could completely take over the Foscam cameras.
The experts from VDOO has published a technical analysis of the three vulnerabilities, including a proof-of-concept code.
“One of the vendors for which we found vulnerable devices was Foscam, when our team discovered a critical chain of vulnerabilities in Foscam security cameras. Combining the discovered vulnerabilities, if an adversary successfully obtains the address of the camera, he can gain root access to the affected cameras remotely (over LAN or the internet).” reads the analysis published by VDOO.
“VDOO has responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-6830, CVE-2018-6831 and CVE-2018-6832) and engaged with Foscam security team to solve the matter.”
Below the attack scenario described by VDOO on a network-accessible camera:
The attack scenario on a network-accessible camera is as follows:

In June 2017, experts at F-Secure discovered tens of vulnerabilities in tens of thousands of Internet-connected cameras from China-based manufacturer Foscam, but at the time the Chinese firm ignored the report from the security firm.
The experts published a long list of affected Foscam device models and firmware versions, users urge to update the firmware as soon as possible.
Likely many other camera models from other vendors could be affected by the vulnerabilities because Foscam also provides its products in white-label mode.
