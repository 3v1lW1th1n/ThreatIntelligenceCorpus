False positive alerts in "Tools"











Threat Intelligence Team, 27 May 2009

False positive alerts in "Tools"Are you always sure that what you are  downloading is safe? Every day, many of our users report “false positive alerts” to us. I use quotes, because most of them are actually malware.  See the picture below. The reported “wrong-detection” is Win32:Ardamax-LV [Spy].

Ardamax is a well known legitimate keylogger, but the “bad guys” often use it to steal account information. In this case, keylogger is a part of some hack. This is the reason why 90% of antivirus programs detect this keylogger as suspicious (VirusTotal report).
So, do you put your trust in unknown web sources such as RapidShare, MegaUpload etc. or in your antivirus program?
