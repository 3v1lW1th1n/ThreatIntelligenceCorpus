CloudFlare firms revealed that one of its customers was recently hit by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that appeared to leverage a mobile ad network and malicious JavaScript.
The experts explained that the DDoS attack relied on a JavaScrip that generates legitimate HTTP requests.
The possible exploitation of ad network was discussed two years ago at the Black Hat conference by the experts Jeremiah Grossman and Matt Johansen.

Unfortunately, this kind of DDoS attack is being popular in the hacking community, in April security researchers from the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Toronto have uncovered a powerful weapon of the Chinese Government cyber arsenal, dubbed the Great Cannon, used to hit websites with powerful DDoS attacks. The Great Cannon has been used by Chinese authorities to knock-out two anti-censorship GitHub pages and it can be also used as a hacking tool to silently install malware on the targeted machine.
The experts explained that the Great Cannon relies on malicious JavaScript injected into unencrypted traffic in order to carry on DDoS attacks.
Another similar DDoS attack was uncovered last week, experts at Imgur discovered that a vulnerability in the platform was exploited by attackers to target the imageboards 4chan and 8chan.
Now, CloudFlare noticed a large number of HTTP requests addressing one of its customer’s website, the DDoS attack peaked at over 1 billion requests per hour. The experts observed a total of 4.5 billion requests reaching the content delivery network’s servers on the day of the attack.

The overall number of unique IP addresses originating the requests is 650,000, 99.8 percent these addresses belong to China.
Experts at CloudFlare discovered that nearly 80 percent of the requests were originated from mobile devices (mobile apps and browsers commonly used by Chinese users).
“Attacks like this form a new trend,” states a blog post published by CloudFlare. “They present a great danger in the internet — defending against this type of flood is not easy for small website operators.”
“There is no way to know for sure why so many mobile devices visited the attack page, but the most plausible distribution vector seems to be an ad network,” Majkowski wrote. “It seems probable that users were served advertisements containing the malicious JavaScript. [These] ads were likely showed in iframes in mobile apps, or mobile browsers to people casually browsing the internet.” explained the researcher Marek Majkowski.
The experts discovered that the websites from the “Referer” header pointed to an ad aggregator or a link farm. The DDoS attack relies on a JavaScript hosted on these pages and that was able to generate a large number of XMLHttpRequest (XHR) requests.
CloudFlare researchers excluded that the DDoS attack was conducted by injecting TCP packets like observing in the DDoS attack conducted by the Great Cannon.
CloudFlare provided the following description for the attack scenario:
“It seems the biggest difficulty is not in creating the JavaScript — it is in effectively distributing it. Since an efficient distribution vector is crucial in issuing large floods, up until now I haven’t seen many sizable browser-based floods,” Majkowski added.
