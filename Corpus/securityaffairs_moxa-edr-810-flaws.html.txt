					Talos experts found many high severity flaws in Moxa EDR-810 industrial routers					
The Moxa EDR-810 is an integrated industrial multiport router that implements firewall, NAT, VPN and managed Layer 2 switch capabilities.
These devices are used in industrial environments to protect systems such as PLC and SCADA systems in factory automation and DCS in oil and gas organizations.
“Today, Talos is disclosing several vulnerabilities that have been identified in Moxa EDR-810 industrial secure router.” reads the security advisory published by Talos.
“Moxa EDR-810 is an industrial secure router with firewall/NAT/VPN and managed Layer 2 switch functions. It is designed for Ethernet-based security applications in remote control or monitoring networks. Moxa EDR-810 provides an electronic security perimeter for the protection of critical assets such as pumping/ treatment systems in water stations, DCS systems in oil and gas applications, and PLC/SCADA systems in factory automation.”
Researchers have discovered many high severity command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-12120, CVE-2017-12121, CVE-2017-12125, CVE-2017-14432 to 14434) affecting the web server functionality.
Some of the issues discovered by Cisco Talos team could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and obtain a root shell on the target Moxa EDR-810 devices by simply sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests.
“TALOS-2017-0472 is an exploitable command injection vulnerability that exists in the web server functionality of Moxa EDR-810. A specially crafted HTTP POST can cause a privilege escalation resulting in attacker having access to a root shell.” reads the description for the CVE-2017-12120 flaw.
“An attacker may be able to inject OS commands into the ifs= parm in the “/goform/net_WebPingGetValue” uri to trigger this vulnerability and take control over the targeted device.”
Similar is the CVE-2017-12121 that resides in the web server functionality of Moxa EDR-810.
“A specially crafted HTTP POST can cause a privilege escalation resulting in attacker having access to a root shell. An attacker can inject OS commands into the rsakey\_name= parm in the “/goform/WebRSAKEYGen” uri to trigger this vulnerability and take control over the targeted device.” continues the analysis published by Talos.

The experts also discovered several high severity DoS vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-14435 to 14437, CVE-2017-12124, CVE-2017-14438 and 14439) that can be exploited by sending specially crafted requests to the device.
“TALOS-2017-0476 is an exploitable denial of service vulnerability that exists in the web server functionality of Moxa EDR-810. Access to a specially crafted HTTP URI can cause a null pointer dereference resulting in the web server crashing. An attacker can send a crafted URI to trigger this vulnerability.” reads the description for the CVE-2017-12124.
The experts also reported four medium severity issues related to the storage in plaintext of the passwords, information disclosure affecting the Server Agent functionality, and the use of weakly encrypted or clear text passwords.
Moxa has released an updated version of the firmware to address the above issues.
