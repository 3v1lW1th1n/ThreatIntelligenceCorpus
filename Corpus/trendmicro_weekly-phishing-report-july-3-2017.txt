Weekly Phishing Report: July 3, 2017

This week, we saw a slight increase (<5%) in phishing activity. Three industries from the top 20 brands saw increases:  Storage & System Management Software (>70%), Internet & Information Services (>20%), and Banking (>20%).  The industries that saw the biggest decreases were: eCommerce (>40%), Electronic Payment Systems (>25%), and Computer Hardware (>15%).
Two changes we saw in phishing activity included the Hospitality industry jumping back on the top 20 list, and Dating Sites falling off.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
