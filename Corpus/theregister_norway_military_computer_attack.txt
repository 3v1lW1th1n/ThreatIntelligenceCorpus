Norway's military computers targeted in serious attack
Norwegian military officials said they were targeted in a serious computer attack that struck in late March, one day after the country's F-16 fighter jets participated in bombings on Libya, according to published news reports.
On March 25, about 100 military employees received an email in Norwegian that included an attachment that installed a data-stealing trojan when opened, Agence France-Presse reported. The news service, citing the Norwegian Defense Information Infrastructure, said only one computer containing non-classified information was compromised. Among the recipients were high-ranking military personnel.
"The army is regularly the target of cyber and virus attacks, but not as extensive as this," AFP quoted INI spokeswoman Hilde Lindboe as saying.
Norway has six F-16s stationed in Crete as part of NATO's campaign against Moammar Gaddafi's forces. ®
