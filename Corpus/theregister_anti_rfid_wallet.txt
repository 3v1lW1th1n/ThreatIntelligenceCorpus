Steel-woven wallet pledges to keep RFID credit cards safe
Worried someone may try to wirelessly nab your personal details from those RFID cards in your wallet? Get some peace of mind with the “identity theft preventing privacy wallet”, its seller claims.
We kid you not. According to its online retailer, the wallet is woven from over 20,000 super-fine strands of stainless steel which “protects your ID like armour plate”.

The idea is sound, in principle. The stitching methodology reminded us of a Faraday cage – an enclosure designed to block out external electric fields.
The wallet promises to completely shield its contents from today’s hi-tech pickpockets, while also being stronger than leather.
Speaking of contents, the wallet can hold six cards, has two internal slots and a billfold – that’s a fiver folding flap to our British readers.
Two designs are available – “Smooth” and “Engine-Turned” - online now, each priced at $80 (£49/€55). ®
