Tip of the week: free Safari from ad banners
Ad banners can show false and even dangerous information, launch noisy videos without permission and consume a lot of traffic. If you use mobile connection, viewing ads can be a paid activity. You can stop the advertisement tyranny on your iPhone or iPad with the help of Kaspersky AdCleaner — free extension for Safari.
For that you should do the following:
Kaspersky AdCleaner checks if there is an ad on the page with the help of our own block list. It also uses popular bases, provided by the third parties. If you click the “i” button located near the name of each base, you’ll see its detailed description.
If you see a banner ad that has not been unblocked, you can report it and thereby help us and other users. To do that, open the website, then choose “Share” and “Report Ads.”
