A free tool to check your system for malware
Someone may call it paranoia; some think it’s just common sense: At Kaspersky Lab we know it’s a good idea to check twice if you suspect something might be wrong with your PC. With so many threats online — ransomware, keyloggers, trojans — it’s better to be safe than sorry.
Kaspersky Security Scan, our free tool for Windows, can check your system for malware, viruses, and software vulnerabilities. It leverages our premium antivirus engine to detect the latest cyberthreats before they can infect your computer. In addition, it automatically keeps the most important software in your system up to date.
In case you didn’t know, cybercriminals often take advantage of bugs (exploitable flaws in software) to get inside their victims’ PCs. That’s why every Internet user should install patches and security updates for their systems and software as soon as they become available. Kaspersky Security Scan can take care of this task for you as well.

Having scanned your computer, the tool creates a detailed report on any detected threats and vulnerabilities, which includes recommendations on how to eliminate them and improve the protection of your system.
