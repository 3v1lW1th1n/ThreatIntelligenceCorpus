Weekly Phishing Activity: November 14, 2016

In this week’s phishing activity report, we saw a minimal increase in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Internet Search & Navigation Systems (>5%) and eCommerce (>30%) were the only industries to see an increase in activity. We saw the largest decreases in Email Providers (>55%), Social Networks (>35%), and Computer Hardware (>15%).
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
