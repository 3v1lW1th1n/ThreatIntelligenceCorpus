POS Malware Overview for the 2014 Holiday Shopping Season
By Dan Mitchell on December 2, 2014
Almost a year has passed since the infamous Target breach that took place during the 2013 holiday shopping season, resulting in the digital theft of an unprecedented 70 million consumer credit cards and dominating headlines in the weeks that followed.
In 2014, the trend continued with a long list of other major retailers, and thousands of smaller retailers alike, who discovered or were notified of breaches using similar strains of POS malware. Many instances of new malicious code introduced more sophisticated capabilities and methods while others shared code and functionality from their predecessors. The following analysis will focus on demonstrating how open source intelligence from Recorded Future can be used to gain insight and provide the “big picture” on this epidemic, concentrating specifically on the following angles:

Current analysis on POS malware has been a mounting challenge for information security professionals and researchers throughout the global community. Each successive breach and new malware strain seems to be closely related or at least bears resemblance to its predecessor.
A large portion of analysis has been riddled with misattribution and convolution for two reasons. First, many of the important technical details and indicators remain barricaded behind the red tape of law enforcement investigations, so actual samples of malicious code have been sparse until very recently. Secondly, the malware variants being discovered have functional symmetry and structure but are being used by a wide and diverse set of threat actors; some acting alone, others in highly organized fashion and others with clear political and possibly even militant agendas.
One thing is certain, we are dealing with an increasingly sophisticated and well orchestrated set of adversaries on multiple fronts. This also applies to the broader cyber threat landscape. One has to wonder if there’s a state-sponsored adversary at play here; intent on disrupting the US economy by dismantling consumer confidence and trust. Retailers will have to be vigilant about protecting their consumers credit card and other personal data by investing in new payment card technology and manufacturers will need to innovate systems that are less prone to exploitation.
It will take some time for the consumer to regain trust in the wake of these breaches. Some retailers have already begun to transition, or have publicly stated their plans to upgrade, to the newer and more secure EMV payment systems, also known as chip and PIN. This technology has already been widely adopted throughout Europe and while it may help mitigate some of the risk of today’s credit card theft at the terminal, it will by no means be a silver bullet.
Retailers will need to couple the adoption of new payment technology with sound security practices, including the acceptance of a more advanced capability to monitor threats and suspicious activity both on the inside and outside world as it pertains to their network traffic.
