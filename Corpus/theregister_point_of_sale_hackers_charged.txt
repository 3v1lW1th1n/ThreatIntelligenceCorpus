Four Romanians charged with hacking 150 Subway shops
Four Romanian nationals were charged with pocketing millions of dollars by hacking into the credit card processing systems of more than 200 businesses.
The men remotely accessed point-of-sale systems of 150 Subway sandwich shops and 50 unnamed retailers and stealing credit card data for more than 80,000 customers, according to a federal indictment unsealed earlier this week. They used the stolen account information to make unauthorized purchases worth millions of dollars, prosecutors said.
The men allegedly scanned the internet to identify POS terminals that used certain remote desktop software applications and then gained unauthorized access to them by guessing or brute forcing passwords.
The indictment, filed in US District Court in New Hampshire, named Adrian-Tiberiu Oprea, 27, Iulian Dolan, 27, Cezar Iulian Butu, 26, and Florin Radu, 23. They were each charged with four counts, including conspiracy to commit computer fraud, wire fraud, and two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with access device.
