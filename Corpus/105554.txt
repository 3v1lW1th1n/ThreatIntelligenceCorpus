ICS-CERT Warns of Heartbleed Vulnerabilities in Siemens Gear
A number of ICS products from Siemens and Innominate are vulnerable to the OpenSSL heartbleed flaw, some of which do not have updates available yet.
The list of products affected by the heartbleed vulnerability continues to grow by the day, with OpenVPN being one of the latest. A researcher on Friday said that he was able to extract a private key from a vulnerable OpenVPN server after hitting it with a large volume of requests over the course of several hours.
Now, the ICS-CERT has issued an advisory warning that several products from Siemens and one from Innominate are vulnerable to the heartbleed attack. The mGuard firmware from Innominate, versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.1 are vulnerable to the attack, but the company has issued an update that addresses the flaw.
Meanwhile, Siemens has identified a number of its products that contain the heartbleed vulnerability. The list of vulnerable products include:
“A successful “HeartBleed” exploit of the affected products by an attacker with network access could allow attackers to read sensitive data (to include private keys and user credentials) from the process memory,” the advisory says.
By some estimates, OpenSSL is deployed on more than half of the SSL-protected Web servers worldwide, but that’s just one piece of the puzzle. The library also is used in embedded devices, industrial control systems and other systems, some of which are just coming to light now.
