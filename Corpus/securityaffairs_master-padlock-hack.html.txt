Have you ever gone in the Gym and after a long and tiring workout forget your padlock numbers? I sure did, but next time I will not call the janitor, I will try to hack into it and find my combination because now there is an easy way to do it.
This can be done with Master PadLock branded padlocks (due a vulnerability) and allows you to learn the combination in around eight tries.
To accomplish this, you need to follow the instructions  provided by Samy Kamkar (@SamyKamkar) and use the calculator created by him, and all this involves, you lift up the lock shackle with your index finger and turning the dial starting from zero, clockwise, like you can see in the following image.

“Master Lock combination padlocks have been known to be vulnerable to an attack that reduces their 64,000 possible combinations down to 100. I’ve devised a new attack for cracking any Master combo lock that simplifies the process and reduces the amount of work down to only 8 combinations. Use this calculator in conjunction with the instructions below to find the 8 possible combinations for your Master combo lock.” wrote Samy Kamkar.
Samy Kamkar published a video PoS that explain the steps to do:
