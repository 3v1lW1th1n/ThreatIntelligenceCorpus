LookingGlass Weekly Phishing Report: July 17, 2017

This week, we saw a (>20%) increase in overall phishing activity from the top 20 brands we monitor. Of those industries that experienced phishing increases, eCommerce (>80%), Electronic Payment Systems (>55%), and Storage and System Management Software (>30%) were the most affected. Two changes we saw in phishing activity included the Hospitality industry jumping back on the top 20 list, and Dating Sites falling off.
Only two industries experienced decreases in phishing activity: Social Networks (>20%) and Internet and Information Services (>5%).
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
