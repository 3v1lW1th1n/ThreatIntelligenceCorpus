“This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard F. Smith. “We pride ourselves on being a leader in managing and protecting data, and we are conducting a thorough review of our overall security operations. We also are focused on consumer protection and have developed a comprehensive portfolio of services to support all U.S. consumers, regardless of whether they were impacted by this incident.”

While Twitter may have chimed in with some humor on this, this is really serious and not a laughing matter at all. So you are probably asking yourself: What can I do? or Has my information been accessed?
For starters, you can visit this site set up by Equifax. If you prefer the phone, you can also give them a ring at 866-447-7559. The company will also be sending notices in the mail to users who have had personally identifiable data and credit card numbers exposed.
