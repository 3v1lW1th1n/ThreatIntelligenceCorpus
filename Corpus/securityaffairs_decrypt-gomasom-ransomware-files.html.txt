Ransomware are the most threatening cyber threats for end-users, but today I have a good news for victims of the Gomasom ransomware, victims can rescue their locked files.
The news was spread by the security researcher Fabian Wosar that developed a tool that could be used by victims to decrypt their file locked by the Gomasom Ransomware.
Gomasom (“GOogle MAil ranSOM“) is a new threat in the criminal ecosystem, it encrypts users’ files, leaving a Gmail address in each file’s name, and adding the .crypt file extension at the end.
The tool analyzes the encrypted files allows users to get the decryption key and use it to decrypt their files. Wosar explained that the tool has a high success rate when the victim has the ability to analyze both the ransomware-encrypted and original version of a document.
Anyway it is always possible to retrieve the key with the tool because victims can take a PNG file encrypted with the ransomware, and compare it to a random PNG file from the Internet.
The tool to decrypt the file locked by Gomasom ransomware is available on the website of the Emsisoft security firm, meanwhile a user guide is available on the Bleeping Computer forum thread.
