The IT Giants Apple, Google and Microsoft always denied any involvement in the surveillance program despite Edward Snowden as produced different documents attesting to the inconvenient truth. Now a new event is shocking the public opinion, leaked emails show that the Google company is supporting NSA for his activities.
The broadcaster Al Jazeera published the emails exchanged between Google executives Sergey Brin, the executive chairman of Google Eric Schmidt and former NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, suggest that principal IT companies was supporting the NSA for a long period.
“Email exchanges between National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander and Google executives Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt suggest a far cozier working relationship between some tech firms and the U.S. government than was implied by Silicon Valley brass after last year’s revelations about NSA spying.” reports Al Jazeera.
“Alexander, Schmidt and other industry executives met earlier in the month, according to the email. But Alexander wanted another meeting with Schmidt and “a small group of CEOs” later that summer because the government needed Silicon Valley’s help.”“About six months ago, we began focusing on the security of mobility devices,” Alexander wrote. “A group (primarily Google, Apple and Microsoft) recently came to agreement on a set of core security principles. When we reach this point in our projects we schedule a classified briefing for the CEOs of key companies to provide them a brief on the specific threats we believe can be mitigated and to seek their commitment for their organization to move ahead … Google’s participation in refinement, engineering and deployment of the solutions will be essential.” continues the post published by Al Jazeera.
