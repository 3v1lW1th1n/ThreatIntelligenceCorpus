Weekly Phishing Report: July 25, 2016
Week of July 17 – July 23, 2016
This week, only brands from 9 industries were present on the top 20, shy of 3 compared to last week’s phishing report.
In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >20% increase in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Social Networks (>205%), Internet and Information Services (>170%), and Dating Sites (>55%) saw the biggest increases in activity. Additionally, Storage and Systems Management Software (>10%) saw the biggest decrease in phishing.
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
