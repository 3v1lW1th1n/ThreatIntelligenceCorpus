Hacking-Back: Six Justifications for Doing It and What’s Wrong With Each One
If the idea of “hacking-back” against cybercriminals who have harmed you or your company has seized you, your executive team, or your spouse as a reasonable thing to do, read on.  It’s an incredibly risky strategy.
First let’s look at why we’d ever dream of doing it in the first place: there are six likely motives or apparent “incentives” to hack back.  They are:
Also, since innocent third parties – whose systems were infected – may be hurt by a hack-back, we must be certain we know who is ultimately responsible.  This is complicated by the fact that cybercriminals know the tools anti-cybercriminal organizations use to establish attribution.  This means they can use them to hide who they are.  For example, they will add language of another nationality to the code, launch attacks from ISPs in other countries, and even outsource their attacks to other hackers.  Because of this, absolute attribution is considered virtually impossible these days unless there is a signed confession.
 
Our position on hacking back is simple: it never makes sense. First, it’s illegal. Second, decisions to do this are almost always emotionally based, and the costs may skyrocket disastrously. Third, the companies who venture into hacking-back take extra risks for themselves – with potentially dire repercussions – and the innocent third parties. These companies have much more to lose in an all-out hacking war than the attackers in almost every conceivable case.
There are a few techniques of active defense which could foil future attacks, making counterstrikes unnecessary.
These should include:
