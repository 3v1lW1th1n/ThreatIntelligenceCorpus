Raj Samani: The Director’s Cut
Regcast after dark After our recent Regcast in which Raj Samani of McAfee's Intel Security scared us to death about security threats businesses are facing (before showing us how automating our security systems means we’re not doomed if we do the right thing), we got the sense he had more to say.


We were right. So we sat Raj down for another 15 minutes of after-hours conversation about our state of readiness for security threats (bad), whether things will get worse before they get better (probably), and some more of his practical advice (good).
