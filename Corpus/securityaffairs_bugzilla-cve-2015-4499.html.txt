The open source Bugzilla bug-tracking system is used hundreds of thousands of software organizations that track the evolution of software bugs discovered in their applications.
Development team urge to upgrade Bugzilla bug tracking system to fix the critical flaws, last version available for the popular application is the 5.0.1, 4.4.10, or 4.2.15.
The bug in Bugzilla is considered critical due to the sensitive data are managed by such kind of application, a data breach could expose information on non-public vulnerability to the hackers that could use them in cyber attacks.
An attacker can easily breach unpatched Bugzilla database, among the illustrious organizations that use the bug tracking system there are the Apache Project, Red Hat and LibreOffice.
The researchers explained that the vulnerability is “extremely easy to exploit,” the attackers just need to register for a regular account via email and trick the system into believing that the attacker is part of a privileged domain which allow it to gain domain-specific permissions.
“If you are using email based permissions in your Bugzilla deployment and have not yet installed a patched version, take it down until patched. Make sure to go over the logs and user-list to identify users that were created using this vulnerability. This vulnerability is extremely easy to exploit and the details have been known for more than a week, you have been or will be attacked!”  explained
The researchers tested the flaw on Mozilla’s Bugzilla.mozilla.org and found that all Perl-based Bugzilla versions, including 2.0 to 4.2.14, 4.3.1 to 4.4.9, 4.5.1 to 5.0, were vulnerable.
“This vulnerability has been tested and found working on Bugzilla.mozilla.org – the Bugzilla for the Mozilla Foundation. Upon successful exploitation of the vulnerability we were granted permissions that would have potentially allowed us to view confidential data (see screen capture below). ” states the post.

At the time I’m writing there are no information whether the Bugzilla vulnerability has been exploited in the wild to gain access to non-public vulnerabilities.
