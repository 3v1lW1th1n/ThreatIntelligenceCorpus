The cyber crime body of knowledge is the application of risk management to cyber crime context in order to manage virtual space risk and vulnerabilities, i.e.: The business risk associated with the use of: cyber space, cybernet, e-cyber operation, virtual space involvement, influence and adoption of cyber technology within an enterprise.
Cyber crime risk management can be considered a component of a wider enterprise risk management system and unique to its own in that it is adopted for management across both enterprises and law-enforcement.

The establishment, maintenance and continuous update of an information security management system (ISMS) provide a strong indication that a company is using a methodical approach for the identification, assessment and management of cyber crime risks.
