OWASP Top 10 out ! (2010)


Hi Folks, this morning I recommend this reading (OWASP Top 10 for 2010) as one of the fundamental reading of all pen-testers.Summing up the reading:The OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks for 2010 are:A1: InjectionA2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)A3: Broken Authentication and Session ManagementA4: Insecure Direct Object ReferencesA5: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)A6: Security MisconfigurationA7: Insecure Cryptographic StorageA8: Failure to Restrict URL AccessA9: Insufficient Transport Layer ProtectionA10: Unvalidated Redirects and ForwardsPlease help us make sure every developer in the ENTIRE WORLD knows about the OWASP Top 10 by helping to spread the world!!!As you help us spread the word, please emphasize:OWASP is reaching out to developers, not just the application security communityThe Top 10 is about managing risk, not just avoiding vulnerabilitiesTo manage these risks, organizations need an application risk management program, not just awareness training, app testing, and remediationWe need to encourage organizations to get off the penetrate and patch mentality. As Jeff Williams said in his 2009 OWASP AppSec DC Keynote: “we’ll never hack our way secure – it’s going to take a culture change” for organizations to properly address application security.
