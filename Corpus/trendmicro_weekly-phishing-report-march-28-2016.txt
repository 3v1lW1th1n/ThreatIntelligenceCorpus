Weekly Phishing Report: March 28, 2016
Week of March 20 – March 26, 2016

In this week’s phishing report, we saw an increase (>5%) in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. For the industries with the biggest changes in phishing activity, we saw increases in Banking (>45%) and Electronic Payment Systems (>40%), and a decrease in Internet & Information Services (>25%).

Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
