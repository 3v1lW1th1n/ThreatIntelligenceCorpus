iTunes Connect does developer shuffle
Apple has kicked off an impromptu game of musical chairs on iTunes Connect dropping developers into random accounts including one lucky punter who was allegedly handed Blackberry's portal.
The glitch, which surfaced a few hours ago at the time of writing, has since been resolved after developers were randomly logged into accounts they did not own.
iTunes Connect is a tool that allows Apple developers to upload and manage apps, and sell content.
Reports emerged on Twitter hours before Apple took the service offline and acknowledged the flaw on its status page. It also admitted that its beta TestFlight service was affected.



It was unclear how many accounts were affected or what caused the glitch. Twitter reports show that many but not all accounts were shuffled.
Apple has been contacted for comment.



Cupertino's developer facilities last experienced trouble in July 2013 after an intruder attempted and failed to steal personal information leading to the Developer Centre being pulled offline amid an emergency security upgrade. ®
