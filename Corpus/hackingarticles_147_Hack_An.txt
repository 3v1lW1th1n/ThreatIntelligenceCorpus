Hack Android Phone WhatsApp and all Directories using Mercury Browser Vulnerability

This module exploits an unsafe intent URI scheme and directory traversal found in Android Mercury Browser version 3.2.3. The intent allows the attacker to invoke a private WIFI manager activity, which starts a web server for Mercury on port 8888. The web server also suffers a directory traversal that allows remote access to sensitive files. By default, this module will go after web view Cookies Chromium.db, web view Cookies Chromium Private.db, webview.db, and bookmarks.db. But if this isn’t enough, you can also specify the ADDITIONAL_FILES data store option to collect more files.
