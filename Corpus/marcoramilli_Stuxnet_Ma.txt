Stuxnet Malware.


Folks, one of the most interesting malware I've ever seen: the Stuxnet, reprogramming industrial control systems. Its final goal is to reprogram industrial control systems (ICS) by modifying code on programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to make them work in a manner the attacker intended and to hide those changes from the operator of the equipment. In order to achieve this goal the creators amassed a vast array of components to increase their chances of success. Thanks to Symantec great report on it !Good Job guys !
