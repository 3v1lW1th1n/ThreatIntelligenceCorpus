Kensington revamps laptop lock
Kensington has introduced a new laptop locking mechanism it hopes will ensure fewer of us lose our computers to the light-fingered.
Dubbed ClickSafe, the system uses the famous "Kensington Slot" - found on almost all portable computers these days - into which you fit a new "anchor unit". The ClickSafe lock simply clips directly onto the anchor, locking as it goes.
That simplicity, the company claimed, will make it darn sight more likely that users will actually lock their machines.
With the lock in place, you need a special key to remove it. Kensington is providing an online key registration and replacement service, and it's possible to get a master key made that will unlock a small group of keys - handy if you manage a group of laptops and you want to give a set of locks to your users.
The "tamper proof" lock is connected to a loop cable constructed from seven seven-strand steel lines designed to thwart attempts at cutting the cord.
The ClickSafe lockhead pivots 180° and rotates a full 360° around the cable to it shouldn't hinder how you lay your laptop down.
The basic lock and cable combo costs £60, Kensington said, and it's also offering a £75 alternative that has has two locks fitted - both opened with the same key - to secure extra items of kit.
The locks are available now direct from Kensington or from a variety of computer and accessory sellers. ®
