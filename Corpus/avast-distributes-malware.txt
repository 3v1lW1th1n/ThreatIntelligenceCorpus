BJSeptember 18, 2017 at 5:43 AMI have the 5.34 version of CCleaner installed on my computer and i had probably the 5.33 version before. My computer is still vulnerable or not ? What can I do to ensure my computer is clean ?ReplyDeleteCraig WilliamsSeptember 18, 2017 at 6:10 AMThis isn't a vulnerability. The 5.33 installer had malware included with it during the time window indicated in the blog. If you upgraded from 5.33 which was installed in the above window you should recover from a backup prior to that version. ReplyDeleteUnknownSeptember 18, 2017 at 7:03 AMThanks for this write up, I really appreciate how you made a pretty complex thing approachable and easy to read. I think a major problem with cyber security articles is they are either too lite or too technical, this article did a great job at striking a balance. As your average data analyst with no feed in dev or security it gave me a great overview. thank you.

To remove the malware you should restore from a previous backup that is known to be clean or try a virus removal tool. DeleteReplyUnknownSeptember 18, 2017 at 11:13 AMReally excellent work, well done on the detective work ^_^ReplyDeletedad98252September 18, 2017 at 11:17 AMThat's an impressive amount of reverse engineering that you did in only 5 days.

Did this nasty hacker go through all the trouble of blanking headers and encryption and then not strip debugger information from his object files??-John in GreenbankReplyDeleteRepliesCraig WilliamsSeptember 18, 2017 at 2:20 PMIt only took the reversing team 2 days to reverse the malware. There were no symbols of debugger info contained in the binary.
