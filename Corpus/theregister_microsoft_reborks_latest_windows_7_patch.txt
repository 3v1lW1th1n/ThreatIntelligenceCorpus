Microsoft RE-BORKS Windows 7 patch after reboot loop horror
Reports are emerging that a twice-issued Microsoft Windows 7 patch is still causing pain for users, with some claiming the fix is triggering continuous reboots.
The patch was first issued as KB2949927 and withdrawn in October due to system faults, before being re-released this week as KB3033929.
Sporadic reports across internet forums suggest the patch is causing pain on Windows systems, especially PCs that boot into two or more operating systems.
The Register has sought confirmation of the problems from Microsoft.
Redmond's initial hope was that the patch would bring SHA-2 code signing support for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 users whose operating systems did not previously include that functionality.
Borked systems include a variety of machine models from the likes of HP and Dell, which appear to throw up the error code 80004005.
It seems sensible to avoid the update until Microsoft confirms the problem and/or sorts something out. ®
