Recapping #TheSAS2017 in 10 tweets
If you’ve been following along on our blogs or our social media accounts, you probably know that we take a lot of pride in our annual conference, The SAS, hosted by Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT). The team managing the event always selects a great location and the top research from some of the brightest within our industry.
This year’s event did not disappoint. The speakers not only provided thought-provoking content, but also inspired attendees to share their thoughts on social media. As the guy monitoring many of our social media channels, I had a first-hand look at how active the attendees were — well, them and the spambots that jumped on the thread with offers for 100s of Twitter followers for $5, enhancement products, and discounted tax services.
Our editorial team wanted to see if we could recap the conference, but through tweets rather than in a lengthy blog post. After scanning through the thousands of tweets, I came up with the following to give a holistic view of the event that was #TheSAS2017.
So, dear readers, do you think I missed any great tweets? Let me know via Twitter. And if tweets aren’t your thing, you can also see the event recapped in video below.
