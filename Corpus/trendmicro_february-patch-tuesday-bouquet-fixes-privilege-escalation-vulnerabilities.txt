February Patch Tuesday Is a Bouquet of Fixes for Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities
Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday for February has a bevy of fixes addressing 50 security issues in Windows, Office (including Office Services and Web Apps), SharePoint, Internet Explorer, Edge, and ChakraCore JavaScript engine, as well as additional patches for the notorious Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. Of these, 14 were rated critical. Eight of these security flaws were disclosed through Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative.
A fix for the previous zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash (CVE-2018-4878) was also included in the rollout of patches but was in fact silently pushed out last week.
Majority of the vulnerabilities are related to elevation of privileges. When exploited successfully, these can allow hackers to carry out normally restricted and system-level functions or hijack the affected systems. There are also 11 security issues affecting the Windows kernel that can lead to local privilege escalation and information disclosure when exploited.
Of note are three vulnerabilities:
Adobe also rolled out its own patches (APSB18-02), addressing security issues in Acrobat Reader and Experience Manager on both Windows and Mac platforms. Of the vulnerabilities listed in Adobe’s bulletin — most of which can lead to remote code execution — 26 were disclosed via Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative.
