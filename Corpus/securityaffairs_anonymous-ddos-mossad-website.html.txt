“We are calling upon the Anonymous collective, and the elite hacker groups to join our crusade, and to wage cyber war against the state of Israel once more,” “As a collective ‘Anonymous’ does not hate Israel, it hates that Israel’s government is committing genocide & slaughtering unarmed people in Gaza to obtain more land at the border.” “Palestine will be liberated, and Israel will suffer the same fate Palestine has been suffering for decades under their brutal and savaging regime. No matter how dark it may seem, or how alone you may be, always remember that there are endless warriors that are operating tirelessly around the clock to stand with you, to aid you, to both fight and protect you in these unjustified acts.” reprts a public statement published PasteBin last week.
The #OpSaveGaza is just the last campaign Anonymous organized against the Government of Israel, very popular was the operation #OpIsrael which hit Israeli websites a couple of years ago.
