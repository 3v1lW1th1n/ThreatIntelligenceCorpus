					Russian cybercriminal Roman Seleznev gets another prison sentence					
In April, the Russian hacker Roman Seleznev, aka Track2, Bulba and Ncux, was sentenced to 27 years in prison, he was convicted of causing $170 million in damage by hacking into point-of-sale systems.
The 33-year-old was previously sentenced by a U.S. court to 27 years in prison for 38 counts of wire fraud, hacking, identity theft, and payment card fraud.
Seleznev was pleading guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to commit bank fraud charges on September 7, now he received further 14-year prison sentence for the first charge in Nevada and another 14 years for the second charge in Georgia.
Seleznev must pay roughly $51 million in the Nevada case and more than $2.1 million in the Georgia case.
The overall sentence is added to the previous 27-year sentence.
Seleznev was one of the members of the criminal ring known as Carder.su focused on identity theft and credit card fraud. The hackers advertised his website on Carder.su offering stolen payment card data.
According to the US prosecutors, activities conducted by members of Carder.su caused $50,893,166.35 losses, roughly the same amount that Seleznev has been ordered to pay.

Authorities conducted a massive operation against members of the Carder.su community, they charged 55 individuals and 33 of them have already been convicted.
Seleznev admitted being a “casher” in the Georgia case, he withdrew cash using stolen bank account information. He was involved in a fraudulent activity against an Atlanta-based firm that processed credit and debit card transactions for financial institutions.
Crooks stole more than 45 million payment cards from the financial firm, then they used them to withdraw over $9.4 million from 2,100 ATMs in 280 cities worldwide in less than 12 hours.
