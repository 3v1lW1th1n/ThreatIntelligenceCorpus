					XSS flaws in Zscaler Cloud management software allow logged attackers to hack coworkers					
Serious cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws in the Zscaler Cloud management software could be exploited by attackers to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the browsers of other users who visit the portal.
In order to exploit the flaws, the attacker needs to be logged into the website, then he can take over the accounts of other users and act on their behalf.
Zscaler highlighted that the flaws would only expose the hack users within the same organization, this means that an attacker can only inject code into the webpages of coworkers while they were accessing the Zscaler’s admin portal.
“Zscaler has addressed persistent XSS vulnerabilities identified in admin.zscaler[X].net and mobile.zscaler[X].net portals. The post-auth vulnerabilities would have allowed authenticated admin users to inject client-side content into certain admin UI pages which could impact other admin users of the same company.” reads the security advisory shared by Zscaler. “Zscaler would like to thank Alex Haynes for responsibly reporting the issues and working with Zscaler to ensure that they were properly remediated.” 

Cross-site scripting flaws are wrongly considered minor issues, but they are very insidious and easy to spot also with XSS scanners.
XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code (i.e. browser side script) to a different end user. For further information, I suggest you visit the OWASP website.
