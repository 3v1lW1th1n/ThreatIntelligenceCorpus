Adobe Ships Patches for Flash, Shockwave Players
Adobe published two security bulletins today, resolving a pair of vulnerabilities in both Shockwave and Flash Player.
The Shockwave security update applies to versions 12.0.6.147 and earlier on Windows and Mac OS X and addresses a pair of memory corruption vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-5333 and CVE-2013-5334) that could give an attacker the ability to execute code remotely. Adobe awarded this bug a priority rating of 1, meaning that attackers are likely targeting it – or soon will be targeting it – in the wild.
Adobe also pushed out security updates for versions 11.9.900.152 and earlier of its Flash Player on Windows and Mac OS X and for versions 11.2.202.327 and earlier for Linux systems. The updates address a type confusion vulnerability (CVE-2013-5331) and a memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2013-5332), each of which could enable remote code execution, causing crashes, and potentially giving an attacker control of affected machines.
“Adobe is aware of reports that an exploit designed to trick the user into opening a Microsoft Word document with malicious Flash (.swf) content exists for CVE-2013-5331,” Adobe says in the bulletin announcement. “Adobe Flash Player 11.6 and later provide a mitigation against this attack.”
Adobe is recommending that users of the following:
Adobe is considering the Flash bugs in Windows and Mac OS X highest priority, while Linux Flash bug and the Adobe Air vulnerabilities are only receiving priority ratings of three, meaning that it is unlikely that attackers will target these bugs.
Adobe acknowledges Liangliang Song and Honggang Ren from Fortinet for finding the Shockwave bugs and David D. Rude II of iDefense Labs Attila Suszter of Reversing on Windows blog for finding the Flash bugs.
