The new three critical eBay vulnerabilities, which have been disclosed by three security experts, could allow an attacker to compromise any user account, even if he has already reset the password after the last announcement.
I decided to respond to the appeal of colleagues at TheHackerNews sharing the info the presented in an interesting post.
 
1- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
The first vulnerability is a Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on eBay Website, the flaw was reported by the German security researcher Michael E. to The Hacker News , he discovered a bug on the auction pages that allowed him to inject arbitrary HTML and Javascript code into the eBay website.

2 – Uploaded shell on eBay server
One of the worst scenarios for a security expert is the presence of a shell on its system, this is the theme of the second vulnerability. The security researcher Jordan Jones discovered a critical vulnerability in the eBay website for its employees could allow an attacker to upload a backdoor shell, more details are available on his blog post.
The expert has already reported the vulnerability to the eBay Research Labs page (labs.ebay.com), the following image is a proof-of-concept screenshot for successfully upload of a ‘shell.php’ file (as shown) on the server to control it.
The backdoor, rendered helpless, was deployed at the following address.
