Javascript Enkoder


Hi folks,today I found out this interesting online tool called: Enkoder. Enkoder encodes ( :D ) every HTML code you like.  It is based on a dynamic engine able to encode the same code into many different ways. A simple img's tag encoding follows:By clicking on "Submit" the encoded tag  will appear o_0!Moved into a text file, to see all the encoded tag.Well, pretty clear for being a simple img tag, right ? :D. For those of you who like reversing javascript it will be fun and challenging. For everyone else it is a great way to hide your code.I think it's one of the best javascript obfuscators I've seen so far. Enjoy it !
