However, Costin’s talk is not the only webinar in our “SAS postscript” series. On March 14, Kaspersky Lab security researchers Vicente Diaz and Sergey Lozhkin will hold webinars focused on threat hunting.
The first one, held by Vicente, will teach you how to harvest cyberintelligence when the criminals are completely in the shadows and avoid even the most sophisticated threat hunters. You can join it by registering on BrightTALK directly.
The second one will be dedicated to underground threat intelligence gathering. Sergey Lozhkin will show you what can be found on underground cybercriminal marketplaces, including data on recent trends, leaked vulnerabilities, and the newest financial malware samples. You can join this webinar on BrightTALK as well.
