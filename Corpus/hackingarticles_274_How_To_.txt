How to Hide Website Details in Who is Record (Domain Privacy Protection)

Domain privacy services help by hiding your information from this WHOIS database and substituting the contact information for say your web host.
Domain privacy is a service offered by a number of domain name registrars. A user buys privacy from the company, who in turn replaces the user’s info in the WHOIS with the info of a forwarding service.
A domain privacy feature is like a firewall in computer network – it simply shields your info from the public but your data is still kept in registrar’s database.
