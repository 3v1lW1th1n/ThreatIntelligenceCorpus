Schneider Electric asks users to patch Heartbleed again
Industrial controller vendor Schneider Electric has found that while its own kit wasn't affected by the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug, there are some third party components that need work.
In an advisory published here (PDF), the company says a third-party software component, Tableau from Wonderware, could re-introduce a Heartbleed vulnerability into its systems.
It affects “Tableau Server, versions 8.0.6 through 8.0.9 or 8.1.0 through 8.1.5. This software is provided as a component of our Wonderware Intelligence and Avantis.DSS products”, the advisory states. “Any installations that did not apply the available Tableau Server updates from Wonderware Development Network (WDN) would not be impacted by HeartBleed vulnerability”
Tableau is an analytical data visualisation suite. The vulnerable server component has now been upgraded by Tableau Software, but users that applied a recent update from Schneider may have reverted to an older version of the server.
The company continues to review its own products, and says that “no evidence of the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL were identified”.
Schneider's advisory also says the version of McAfee ePO (the policy orchestrator) that ships with its Invensys control systems is vulnerable. McAfee released patches for its vulnerable products in April. ®
