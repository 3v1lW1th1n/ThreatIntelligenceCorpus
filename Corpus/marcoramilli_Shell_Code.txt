Shell Code Generator


Today I wanna write a little shell code generator useful for embedding and coding shellcodes. Of course you may find more interesting this one (well-known shellcode generator), the following generator written in perl, is a very basic idea of what a shellcode generator does. Feel free to keep and to modify it.#!/usr/bin/perl # shellcode generator  print "shellcode: ";  $x1=<>;  my $data = "$x1";  chomp($data);  my @values = split(undef,$data);   foreach my $val (@values) {   chomp($val);  print '\x';  print unpack(H8,"$val");  }   print "\n";  exit 0;
