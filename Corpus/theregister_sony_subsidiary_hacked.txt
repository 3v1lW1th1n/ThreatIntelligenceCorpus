Hack on Sony-owned ISP steals $1,220 in virtual cash
Sony's So-Net Entertainment subsidiary was hacked by intruders who made off with about $1,200 worth of virtual points, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.
The hacker stole the points from about 128 accounts and was able to read email from about 90 accounts, the Associated Press said.
The Japan-based mobile Internet service provider said it discovered the attack on Wednesday following customer complaints and cut off the IP address behind about 10,000 attempts to break into the system. A So-Net spokesman told the WSJ it was unlikely the hack was related to the massive compromise in April that caused Sony's PlayStation Network to be closed for more than three weeks.
The hack took place on Monday and Tuesday. There's no evidence the attackers accessed personal data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. ®
