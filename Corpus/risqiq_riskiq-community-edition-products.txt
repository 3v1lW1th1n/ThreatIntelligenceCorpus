Announcing RiskIQ Community Edition Products for Threat Hunters and Defenders
It takes a community to tackle digital threats.
As organizations embrace new digital channels to connect with customers and employees, their attack surface grows exponentially. Cybercriminals are exploiting new attack vectors created across these channels—exposures which exist outside the protection of firewalls and traditional security controls.
Today, RiskIQ is introducing a new way for threat hunters and threat defenders to utilize our vast internet data sets and comprehensive intelligence about the web and how organizations appear outside the firewall.
Building on the idea that the security community is made better by being able to share information, insight, and intelligence, RiskIQ Community Edition products are free versions of our software that enable easier, more thorough investigations as well as the ability to gain insight into the digital footprint of organizations.
