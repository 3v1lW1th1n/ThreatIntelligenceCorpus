Hacking Training Center.


From time to time in the ethical hacking communities comes up the question: "Where can we train ?". Many different sites offer greats training challenges but what is the one I am looking for ?What the difference between them ?Thanks to Giacomo (one of the CeSeNA boys), who pointed me out this website,I am now able to write a pretty complete list of hacking "training centers" (I like to call them in this way), here, on my blog .. just  for personal memories.HolynixSimilar to the de-ice Cd’s and pWnOS, holynix is an ubuntu server vmware image that was deliberately built to have security holes for the purposes of penetration testing. More of an obstacle course than a real world example.http://pynstrom.net/index.php?page=holynix.phpWackoPickoWackoPicko is a website that contains known vulnerabilities. It was first used for the paper Why Johnny Can’t Pentest: An Analysis of Black-box Web Vulnerability Scanners found:http://cs.ucsb.edu/~adoupe/static/black-box-scanners-dimva2010.pdfhttps://github.com/adamdoupe/WackoPickoDe-ICE PenTest LiveCDsThe PenTest LiveCDs are the creation of Thomas Wilhelm, who was transferred to a penetration test team at the company he worked for. Needing to learn as much about penetration testing as quickly as possible, Thomas began looking for both tools and targets. He found a number of tools, but no usable targets to practice against. Eventually, in an attempt to narrow the learning gap, Thomas created PenTest scenarios using LiveCDs.http://de-ice.net/hackerpedia/index.php/De-ICE.net_PenTest_DisksMetasploitableMetasploitable is an Ubuntu 8.04 server install on a VMWare 6.5 image. A number of vulnerable packages are included, including an install of tomcat 5.5 (with weak credentials), distcc, tikiwiki, twiki, and an older mysql.http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/05/introducing-metasploitable.htmlOwaspbwaOpen Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Broken Web Applications Project, a collection of vulnerable web applications.http://code.google.com/p/owaspbwa/Web Security DojoA free open-source self-contained training environment for Web Application Security penetration testing. Tools + Targets = Dojohttp://www.mavensecurity.com/web_security_dojo/LampsecurityLAMPSecurity training is designed to be a series of vunlerable virtual machine images along with complementary documentation designed to teach linux,apache,php,mysql security.http://sourceforge.net/projects/lampsecurity/files/Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)Damn Vulnerable Web App is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.http://www.randomstorm.com/dvwa-security-tool.phpHacking-LabThis is the Hacking-Lab LiveCD project. It is currently in beta stadium. The live-cd is a standardized client environment for solving our Hacking-Lab wargame challenges from remote.http://media.hacking-lab.com/largefiles/livecd/v5.39/livecd-iso-image/hl05.39.isoMothMoth is a VMware image with a set of vulnerable Web Applications and scripts, that you may use for:http://www.bonsai-sec.com/en/research/moth.phpDamn Vulnerable Linux (DVL)Damn Vulnerable Linux  is everything a good Linux distribution isn’t. Its developers have spent hours stuffing it with broken, ill- configured, outdated, and exploitable software that makes it vulnerable to attacks. DVL isn’t built to run on your desktop – it’s a learning tool for security students.http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.orgpWnOSpWnOS is on a “VM Image”, that creates a target on which to practice penetration testing; with the “end goal” is to get root. It was designed to practice using exploits, with multiple entry pointshttp://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/backtrack-videos/2748-%5Bvideo%5D-attacking pwnos.htmlhttp://www.krash.in/bond00/pWnOS%20v1.0.zipVirtual Hacking LabA mirror of deliberately insecure applications and old softwares with known vulnerabilities. Used for proof-of-concept /security training/ learning purposes. Available in either virtual images or live iso or standalone formats.http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualhacking/files/BadstoreBadstore.net is dedicated to helping you understand how hackers prey on Web application vulnerabilities, and to showing you how to reduce your exposure.http://www.badstore.net/KatanaKatana is a portable multi-boot security suite which brings together many of today’s best security distributions and portable applications to run off a single Flash Drive. It includes distributions which focus on Pen-Testing, Auditing, Forensics, System Recovery, Network Analysis, and Malware Removal. Katana also comes with over 100 portable Windows applications; such as Wireshark, Metasploit, NMAP, Cain & Able, and many more.www.hackfromacave.com/katana.htmlIf we forgot something, let me know: lets write your comment.
