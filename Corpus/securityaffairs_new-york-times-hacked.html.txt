					OurMine crew hacked the New York Times Twitter video account					
Yesterday around 9:40 a.m. ET the Twitter account shared a fake news about a missile attack from Russia against the United States. The message about the “missile attack” quoted a “leaked statement” from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

That fake news was quickly deleted, while other tweets were claiming the involvement of the dreaded OurMine hacker group. The group, who hacked the Netflix US Twitter account (@Netflix) in December to promote its website and hacking services, is known for its attacks against high-profile Twitter accounts. The list of victims is very long and includes Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, David Guetta Daniel Ek, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the CEO and founder of Spotify, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and many others.
One of the messages shared by OurMine confirmed that the group is responsible for the hijacking of the Sony Music’s Twitter account occurred last month when the hackers tweet a hoax about Britney Spears’ death.
Below the messages shared by the group:
“Message from OurMine: We detected unusual activity on the account and we re-hacked it to make sure if the account is hacked or not,” read one tweet posted to the @nytvideo account Sunday.

All the messages were deleted by IT staff at The York Times, the account also posted a message to confirm that a series of tweets published from the account “without our authorization” were removed.
