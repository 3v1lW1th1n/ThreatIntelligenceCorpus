Smart meter hack framework goes open-source
Security outfit SecureState’s smart meter hacking framework, Termineter, has gone live over at Google Code.
The software is described as having a structure like Metasploit, with a similar interface and ability to be extended with external modules.
Termineter isn’t up to the full doomsday-scenario “remote attack” that troubles owners of critical infrastructure who stupidly opened up their control interfaces to the Internet (so as to save themselves the cost of private networks): it gathers smart meter data over the devices’ local serial optical interfaces.
SecureState announced its intention to release the software at the end of June. At the time, SecureState said the software allowed users to test for vulnerabilities such as energy consumption fraud and network hijacking.
In addition, Termineter can read from and write to tables in the smart meter, as well as parsing security, modem and log tables. To allow it to be open-sourced, the software focuses on the ANSI C12.18 and C12.19 standards used in smart meters. Users would need to write or acquire separate modules to access vendor-specific information.
As SecurityWeek notes, the tool is to be demonstrated in public at Las Vegas at the Security B-Sides conference on Wednesday July 25. ®
