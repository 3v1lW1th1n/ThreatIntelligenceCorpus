What a Spring! Proofpoint Q2 Threat Summary Tracks Ransomware, Exploit Kits, and More
Overview
The first five months of 2016 were dominated by malicious email campaigns of unprecedented volume. New ransomware variants emerged quickly. Meanwhile, Dridex actors began distributing Locky ransomware and repeatedly shifted tactics with new loaders, document attachment types, and obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
Then at the end of May, one of the largest botnets in the world - the so-called Necurs botnet - suddenly went dark. The change brought Dridex and Locky distribution to a near halt. At the same time, the hugely popular Angler exploit kit (EK)—an all-in-one toolkit that largely automates web-based cyber attacks—went silent. Together, these shifts led to an eerily quiet June.
Even as these changes rippled through the industry, social media threats such as fraudulent customer service accounts continued to proliferate. Mobile threats also targeted multiple vulnerabilities and the mobile space looked increasingly like the desktop space, complete with exploit kits and adware.
Below are key takeaways from the second quarter of 2016.
