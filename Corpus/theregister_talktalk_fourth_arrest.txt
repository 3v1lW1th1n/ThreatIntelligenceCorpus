Met makes fourth TalkTalk arrest, this time a London teen
A 16 year-old boy from London has become the fourth to be arrested in connection with the hacking of British telco TalkTalk.
Information is thin on the ground. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Cyber Crime Unit arrested the boy at his Norwich home on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences and he remains in custody.
A search of his home is ongoing.
The teenager is the latest hacker domino to fall since the flaying of the budget telco in which thieves stole 1.2 million customer email addresses, names, and phone numbers, along with 15,000 dates of birth, and 28,000 partial credit and debit cards.</p
Detectives arrested a 20-year-old Staffordshire man on Sunday while two teenagers were picked up in connection with the case last month.
A 15-year-old from Northern Ireland was pinched on 26 October from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and MET detectives, while another 16-year-old from London was arrested 30 October. ®
