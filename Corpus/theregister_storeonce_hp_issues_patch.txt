StoreOnce: HP issues patch
HP has advised The Register that a patch is now available for its StoreOnce storage systems.
Yesterday, we reported that a blogger with the handle Technion had identified an undocumented administrator account in some of its StoreOnce systems. He had also posted the hash of the password associated with the HPSupport account.
Technion had complained, in strong terms, that HP had been unresponsive to his attempts to notify it of the vulnerability.
The vendor has now contacted The Register with the following statement:
“HP identified a potential security issue with older HP StoreOnce models. This does not affect StoreOnce systems with the current version 3.0 software, including the HP StoreOnce B6200 and HP StoreOnce VSA product offerings.
“HP takes security issues very seriously and is working actively on a fix. A customer security bulletin is available here.”
The advisory notes that while the HPSupport account does not offer access to data backed up on the system, it does allow the system to be reset to factory defaults.
In all, twenty variants of its StoreOnce backup systems are affected by the bug, running software versions 2.2.17 or older and 1.2.17 or older. ®
