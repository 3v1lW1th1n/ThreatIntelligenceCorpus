Twitter plans to adopt end-to-end encryption for its Direct Messages, the company is currently testing its new service dubbed ‘Secret Conversation’.
The discovery was made by the computer science student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Jane Manchun Wong that noticed the Secret Conversation feature in the latest version of Android application package (APK) for Twitter.

We have a long debate about the End-to-end encryption that allows secure communications between interlocutors preventing eavesdropping, many companies already implement it for its services, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and Skype.
The Secret Conversation is currently available only to a small number of users for testing purpose.
Unlike other platforms, like WhatsApp, the conversations on Twitter Direct Message will not use the end-to-end encryption by default.
Users have to choose to start an encrypted chat, the principle is similar the Secret Conversations on Facebook Messenger.
Below the steps to start using the new feature on Twitter:
