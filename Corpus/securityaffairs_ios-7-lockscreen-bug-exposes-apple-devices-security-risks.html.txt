Jose Rodriguez has found a lock screen vulnerability in iOS 7, last version of popular Apple mobile OS system. Mr Rodriguez is a 36 year old soldier living in Spain’s Canary Islands, has found a security vulnerability in iOS 7 that allows to bypass lockscreen rapidly to access user’s email, photos, social media like Twitter, and much more.
Rodriguez has demonstrated how to exploit the iOS 7 vulnerability in a video to my friend and colleague Mohit Kumar, founder of the popular security portal The Hacker News.
 

 
Similar vulnerabilities were found in the past version of the popular OS, exploiting lockscreen iOS 7 vulnerability the attackers could have direct access to the iPhone or iPad.
To have an idea of various flaws that affected Apple products I suggest you to read the security advisory proposed by Secunia firm. Multiple weaknesses have been reported in Apple iOS during last months,  the flaws can be exploited by ill-intentioned with physical access to bypass certain security restrictions and by malicious people to disclose sensitive information, conduct brute-force, spoofing, and cross-site scripting attacks, bypass certain security restrictions, cause a DoS (Denial of Service), and compromise a vulnerable device.
The exploit has been successfully verified on iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, and 5S, and iPad running iOS 7, waiting for the official fix from Apple users can disable the control center of the lock screen in their device settings.
