Be aware, cyberbullying is not limited to children because similar practices are diffused within adults, in this case many experts used the term  cyberstalking or cyberharassment to identify the harmful conduct perpetrated by adults toward adults.
Typical cyberbullying conduct is based on the in cyberharassment in public forums, social media, blog and any other form of online media with the intent to threaten a victim’s reputation, earnings, employment or safety. Very common is the habit to encourage others to harass the victim and trying to compromise its online experience on social media.
