Don’t get suckered by online scams this holiday season
By now, you’ve probably seen a ton of advertisements, heard commercials or noticed that your local shops have flipped the switch to that most wonderful time of the year. If you haven’t, well I envy you.
The unofficial kickoff for the holiday season is this week. Before the turkey has settled in many people’s bellies, many will be met with the urge to look down at their buzzing phone for the door-busting deals coming into their emails or shopping apps. While we will probably see the crazy footage associated with Black Friday, Internet Retailers have moved beyond Cyber Monday and created Cyber Week and Cyber Month – making it oh too easy for you to buy that gift because it was on a great sale.
Let’s face it, we all love a great deal. Do you know who else loves all of these deals? Cyber criminals, this time of year is a prime opportunity for them to get their Grinch on.

With all of the great deals out there, it is almost impossible to avoid clicking and taking a look around without question. These criminals hope that you’ve let your guard down and won’t be doing your regular due diligence when clicking links or visiting websites – especially ones with HOT Dealz.
So how can you stay safe shopping online? Here are eight tips to help you keep you safe.
