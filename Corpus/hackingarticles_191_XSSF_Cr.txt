XSSF Cross-Site Scripting Framework in Metasploit (Part 1)

The Cross-Site Scripting Framework (XSSF) is a security tool designed to turn the XSS vulnerability exploitation task into a much easier work. The XSSF project aims to demonstrate the real dangers of XSS vulnerabilities, vulgarizing their exploitation. This project is created solely for education, penetration testing and lawful research purposes.
XSSF allows creating a communication channel with the targeted browser (from a XSS vulnerability) in order to perform further attacks. Users are free to select existing modules (a module = an attack) in order to target specific browsers.
XSSF provides a powerful documented API, which facilitates development of modules and attacks. In addition, its integration into the Metasploit Framework allows users to launch MSF browser based exploit easily from XSS vulnerability.
In addition, an interesting though exploiting an XSS inside a victim’s browser could be to browse website on attacker’s browser, using the connected victim’s session. In most of cases, simply stealing the victim cookie will be sufficient to realize this action. But in minority of cases (intranets, network tools portals, etc.), cookie won’t be useful for an external attacker. That’s why XSSF Tunnel was created to help the attacker to help the attacker browsing on affected domain using the victim’s session.
Open your kali Linux terminal and type cd /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/msf3
In msf3 install xssf using following command
Svn export http://xssf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk ./ –force now xssf is successfully install in your metasploit

Load XSSF plugin using the command ‘load xssf’

Type help xssf to find all xssf commands

Now use xssf_urls command to get all list of all available URL

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.

We can see information related to any of the victims using the command xssf_information
