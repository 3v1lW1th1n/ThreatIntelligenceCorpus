Hack netNTLM Credential using Microsoft Word UNC Path Injector

This module modifies a .docx file that will, upon opening, submit stored net NTLM credentials to a remote host. It can also create an empty docx file. If emailed the receiver needs to put the document in editing mode before the remote server will be contacted. Preview and read-only mode do not work. Verified to work with Microsoft Word 2003, 2007 and 2010 as of January 2013. In order to get the hashes the auxiliary/server/capture/smb module can be used.
