IDS Evasion


Alright folks,yet another paper has been published so I can finally upgrade my blog with some interesting results.In 2009 we (Network Security abs @ University of Bologna) studied a new way to analyze attacks using Data Mining over SNMP artificial variables. Artificial means forged by us, over natural SNMP variables.This pictures show how our approach (we still don't have a name ) reacts to a DOS hidden under "normal traffic".The described approach can also detect many different attacks utilizing the not intrusive SNMP. SNMP is ubiquitous; it runs on every platforms,  from CellPhone to Washing Machines, we don't have to configure IDS, nasty systems or exoteric firewalls; what we need is just analyze SNMP data.So far we don't have a  presentable framework, the current version is in pre-alpha, basically we have a set of scripts which made all the computations. We're looking forward to new students that wanna implement a nice framework. If you are interested on this project (even if you are not a student :D ) please contact me.
