					Nuclear Bot source code leaked online, a new threat will rapidly spread in the wild					

The Trojan can also open a local proxy or hidden remote desktop service to allow crooks to initiate rogue transactions through the victims’ browsers after they have been tricked into providing the second authentication factor.

According to IBM, the creator of the malware has lost his credibility over the months and has been flagged as a scammer in the hacking community. The malware author did not offer a test version of the malware to potential buyers and advertised the Nuclear Bot using different names on different cybercrime forums.
In order to gain credibility and notoriety in the cyber crime community the author of the malware decided on releasing the Trojan’s source code.
The release of malicious code online represents an important milestone in the malware life cycle because give the opportunity to oder malware developers and crime organizations to customize and distribute their own version of the malware.
The NukeBot Trojan appears as a powerful tool written from scratch and that was able in early stage attacks to avoid detection of antivirus solutions.
“We know from previous incidents, such as the Zeus, Gozi and Carberp leaks, that publicly available source code makes for more malware. This is often incorporated into existing projects. X-Force researchers noted that NukeBot is likely to see the same process take place in the wild, especially since its code is not copied from other leaked malware, per the developer’s claims.” continues IBM.
“At this time, NukeBot has not been detected in real-world attacks and does not have defined target lists.”
Security experts expect a growing number of players in cybercrime underground will start to offer the NukeBot Trojan through the consolidated model of sale known as malware-as-a-service.
