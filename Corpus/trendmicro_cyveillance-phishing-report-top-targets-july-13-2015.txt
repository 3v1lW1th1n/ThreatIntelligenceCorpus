The biggest increases in phishing activity were in eCommerce (>15%), followed by Computer Hardware (>5%).

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
