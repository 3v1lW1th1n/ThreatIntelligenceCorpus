SecureData buys into big data, grabs stake in software developer
Security integrator SecureData has coughed an undisclosed sum for a minority stake in Paterva, the developer and purveyor of big data wares.
Security, mobility, social, cloud and big data are the market drivers being talked by vendors from HP and IBM to Microsoft – and now the Kent-based supplier has a footprint in two of those markets.
A suite of tools branded Maltego is used for data mining, link analysis and data virtualisation, with the theoretical aim of extracting valuable patterns or trends from volumes of information.
Etienne Greeff, boss at SecureData said the move was designed to fit with the “broader goal” of buying or building intellectual property that “supports” its services biz.
He said Maltego is used “extensively” in Open Source Intelligence Gathering, Infrastructure Analysis for Penetration Testing, Cyber Attack Analysis, Fraud Detection and Investigation, Security Intelligence and research.
“It’s a significant and growing contender in the intelligence and analytics space,” claimed Greeff.
This is the second investment made by SecureData this year: in January it took over SensePost, which is an accredited Maltego service provider. ®
