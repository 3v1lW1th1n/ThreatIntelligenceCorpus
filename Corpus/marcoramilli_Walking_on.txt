Walking on DC


Hey Folks,today I took the Metro from Gaithersburg to Washington DC. It was a 40 minutes long trip, most of it underground so quite boring but it's still the best way to go in DC. Red line, exit "Metro Central", few miles of walk and here we go.The Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial, two of my favorite DC monuments. Of course around National Mall there are lots of free (or kind of) museums and stuff I love to visit. Today I had not so much time, but next saturday I wanna visit some of them . If you (reader) are living in DC and are so kind to suggest something to visit I'll appreciate.
