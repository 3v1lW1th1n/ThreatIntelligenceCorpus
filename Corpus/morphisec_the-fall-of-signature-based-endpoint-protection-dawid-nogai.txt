Here is a treat for our Polish speaking readers!
In yesterday’s interview with Poranek WTK, Dawid Nogaj, CEO of PC Service and authorized Morphisec distributor in Poland, explains why signature-based endpoint security solutions are on their way out. After his participation at Morphisec’s first Distributor Summit at the beginning of March, Dawid is more convinced than ever that Moving Target Defense is the ultimate answer to advanced threats.
