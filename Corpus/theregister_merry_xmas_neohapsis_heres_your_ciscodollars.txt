Merry Xmas, Neohapsis, here's your Cisco-dollars
Cisco is beefing up its security intelligence-gathering, snapping up privately-held advisory Neohapsis for an undisclosed sum.
Neohapsis is a Chicago-based security advisory and bug archivist outfit, and will boost Cisco's risk management, compliance, cloud, application, mobile and infrastructure security offerings, according to this Cisco post by SVP and head of business development Hilton Romanski.
The deal is expected to close in Q2 of 2015. The Neohapsis group will become part of the Borg's Security Services organisation, led by Bryan Palma.
While old-timers will remember Neohapsis as the destination of choice to look over bug security lists back in the late 1990s, its portfolio has grown far beyond that, with CEO James Mobley writing that the two companies will target “enterprise customers, IoT device manufacturers, and associated service providers”. ®
