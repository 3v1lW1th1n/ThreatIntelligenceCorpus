“We, like many businesses, use a third-party for the technology behind this service and that company, [24]7.ai, told us recently that they were the victim of a cyber intrusion. Their information suggests that the dates for this illegal intrusion were between Sept. 27 and Oct. 12, 2017. [24]7.ai has indicated that customer payment information may have been compromised during that time and, if that were the case, then a number of Best Buy customers would have had their payment information compromised, as well.” reads the security advisory published by Best Buy.
“As best we can tell, only a small fraction of our overall online customer population could have been caught up in this [24]7.ai incident, whether or not they used the chat function.”

It seems that customers of the affected firms may be impacted even if they have not directly used the chat functionality.
The intrusion occurred between September 26 and October 12, 2017.
“We understand malware present in [24]7.ai’s software between Sept. 26 and Oct. 12, 2017, made unauthorized access possible for the following fields of information when manually completing a payment card purchase on any page of the delta.com desktop platform during the same timeframe: name, address, payment card number, CVV number, and expiration date.” reads the advisory published by Delta Airline.
“No other customer personal information, such as passport, government ID, security or SkyMiles information was impacted.”
According to Delta, hundreds of thousands of customers may have been impacted by the payment card breach.
