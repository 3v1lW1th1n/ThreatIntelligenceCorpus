“All I had to do is to change those two parameters to my other twitter account id and credit card id , then reply again the request and I suddenly found that credit card have been delete from the other twitter account without any required interaction,” Aboul-Ela wrote.
“I thought it have the same effect of deleting, so I tried to add invalid credit card again and intercepted the request,” he said.
Be aware, unlike the first flaw, the expert, just modified the credit card Id in the URL and body to his credit card Id from other twitter account and then replied the request.
This means that it was possible to delete from the other twitter account the payment card with the specific Id.
Below the video proof of concept sent by Aboul-Ela.
