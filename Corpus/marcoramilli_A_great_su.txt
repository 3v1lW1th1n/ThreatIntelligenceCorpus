A great sunday reading.


Folks, today I suggest this interesting reading entitled: E-voting: How secure is it?"One of the great fears in an internet election is that you are exposing our votes to manipulation by foreign powers," said Jefferson. "I just consider this to be a major national security risk; a totally unnecessary, needless risk and it's shocking to me that election officials turn away from this. They don't want to hear it, and they certainly don't want to do anything about it."Short, incisive and clear. Take a look.
