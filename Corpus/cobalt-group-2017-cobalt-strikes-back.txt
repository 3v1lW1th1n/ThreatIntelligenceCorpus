Cobalt strikes back: an evolving multinational threat to finance


1. Introduction

2. Executive summary

Active attacks on bank partners in order to use partner infrastructure for sending phishing messages to banks. 
Phishing messages disguised as mailings from financial regulators.
Various types of malicious attachments: document with an exploit (.doc, .xls, .rtf), archive with an executable dropper file (.scr, .exe), and archive with LNK file (.lnk).
Among the first groups to get access to the latest version of the Microsoft Word Intruder 8 exploit builder, which made it possible to create documents exploiting vulnerability CVE-2017-0199.
Poorly protected public sites are used to upload files and then download them to victim computers.
Phishing messages are sent both to corporate addresses and personal addresses of employees.

6. Cobalt attack methods

1. Partner phishing

Attackers get information stored on the servers and in the databases of the compromised partner organization. This information can be used to create convincing phishing messages.
Attackers obtain access to employee accounts on workstations and mail servers, giving phishing messages a high degree of trust and plausibility among potential recipients.
Messages from partners are not blocked by mail server filters.

2. Malicious attachments

In a password-protected ZIP archive, the password to which is given in the text of the phishing message.
Downloaded from a hacked website when a malicious attachment (.doc, .xls, .rtf) is opened from the phishing message. 
Downloaded from a hacked website based on commands coded in a LNK file that is in a ZIP archive attached to the message.
