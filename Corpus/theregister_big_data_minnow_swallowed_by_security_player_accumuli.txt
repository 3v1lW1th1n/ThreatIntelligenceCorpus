Big data minnow swallowed by security player Accumuli
AIM-listed specialist security player Accumuli has coughed £1.9m for small Bracknell-based big data analytics reseller and integrator EQUALIS, it confirmed to the City today.
This bolt-on-buy adds a seven-strong band of big data boffins that sell software from Splunk - for which EQUALIS is Blighty's only authorised training provider - as well as Prelert, Puppet Labs and App Dynamics.
"The key to successfully mitigating IT security threats, detecting incidents and responding to breaches is the ability to access and analyse large quantities of data in real time," said Accumuli CEO Gavin Lyons in a canned statement.
"This level of intelligence and visibility enables companies to prioritise actions, respond to incidents, improve processes and enhance control," he claimed.
Acquisition hungry outfit Accumuli actually sold off part of its business in February, specifically the software unit Webscreen Systems Ltd to Juniper for $10m, but in the main it has been a buyer of businesses.
It took on WBL through the purchase of Boxing Orange in 2011, snapped up security incident and event management biz EdgeSeven in 2012 and more recently took on managed services player Signify Solutions in June.
EQALIS, which has 150 customers of which only 10 per cent are common to Accumuli, turned over £1.75m in sales for the fiscal ended 31 March, and made an EBITDA of £300k.
In its year to 31 March, Accumuli reported sales of £14.1m up from £12.09m, and made an operating profit from continuing operations of £317k versus £367k in the previous fiscal. ®
