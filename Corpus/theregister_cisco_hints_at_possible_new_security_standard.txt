Cisco hints at possible new security standard
Cisco is hoping that a framework it created for its Identity Services Engine (ISE) could offer the basis for a standard for multivendor security integration.
The Borg created the Platform Exchange Grid – pxGrid – to allow third-party developers to integrate with ISE, and has told told NetworkWorld it intends to put the technology to the IETF as a standard early in 2014.
Existing partners in the program include IBM, Splunk, HP, Symantec, Tibco, Lancope and LogRhythm, says NetworkWorld, while mobile device management partners include IBM, Citrix, AirWatch, Good, MobileIron, SAP and MaaS360.
The issue that Cisco says it's trying to address is that information about security events can get siloed by vendor – and that means a lot of the response to security events falls on the shoulders of systems admins.
To alleviate that, Cisco wants to give third parties a means to integrate with the database collected by its ISE – pxGrid – and have that information sharable between partners.
As explained at TCMNet, this integration would also mean better policy management in a cross vendor environment.
The company is now testing pxGrid with selected partners, and plans general availability next year. ®
