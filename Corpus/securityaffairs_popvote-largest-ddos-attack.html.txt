On June 16, Amazon decided to stop providing DNS hosting service to HKU POP and UDomain withdrew its security protection service. Cloudflare is now the only service provider to support the voting system.
Cloudflare confirms that the company network was able to drain the malicious traffic on PopVote website, it has set up a series of DNS sinkholes to track malicious sources involved in the attack.
“Since we had advanced warning the attack was coming, we’d put in place measures to sinkhole traffic in certain regions so it never hit our network,” Prince added.
