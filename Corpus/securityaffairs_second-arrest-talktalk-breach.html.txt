There is a second arrest for the TalkTalk hack, the UK Police have arrested a second individual as part of the investigation into the recent data breach suffered by the company.
Also in this case the arrested individual is a teenager, according to the Metropolitan Police, the second suspect is a 16-year-old boy from Feltham. The teen was arrested on Thursday by agents of the Cyber Crime Unit on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences and was later bailed.
A few days ago the law enforcement arrested of a 15-year-old teen from Northern Ireland in connection to the TalkTalk attack, at this point it is important to discover how the two suspects have been involved in the TalkTalk data breach.

Despite the company has tried to downgrade the risks for its users saying that stolen banking data were incomplete  there is the concrete risk that the information could be abused for fraudulent activities. It is likely that soon we will find them everywhere in the darkweb, the popular investigator Brian Krebs already discovered a very reliable seller, known as “Courvoisier,” (“Level 6 Fraud and Drugs seller,”)  in the AlphaBay Tor black market offering TalkTalk data. It is likely that soon other sellers will start to offer the stolen data on specialized hacking forums.

“The number of customers who may have been affected and the amount of data potentially accessed is also smaller than we originally thought,” TalkTalk said on Wednesday.
Customers impacted by the TalkTalk data breach have been offered free credit reporting services with Noddle. According to the TalkTalk firm, more than 50,000 customers have already accepted the offer.
