Cisco pumps out iPhone security app
Cisco has pushed out a new iPhone app that helps IT managers respond to newly-detected security threats by the seat (pocket) of their pants.
The Cisco SIO To Go iPhone application beams in data from the company's Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) to show a customizable menagerie of security information that could potentially help defend a business network.
At hand are real-time alerts and threat mitigation solutions which come from sources that include more than 700,000 Cisco security devices, the company's historical threat database, 3,300 IPS signatures, and over 600 third-party threat-intelligence sources, Cisco said.
The app also has the ability to check a site or server's "reputation" powered by IronPort — which shows if it's been attacked by a virus over the past 24 hours.
It also includes links to Cisco's security blog, press releases, and Twitter feeds if that's your bag.
While the iPhone isn't known for its enterprise-ready prowess, clearly folks are hooking into businesses with their fancy App shwag anyway. Cisco playing along with an iPhone app is a pretty good indication how common it is inside corporations.
The Cisco app is available now. At the iTunes store, naturally. ®
