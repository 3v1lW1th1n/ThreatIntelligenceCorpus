Quiz: How good of a CISO are you?
Targeted attacks now represent one of the biggest threats to businesses. According to survey data, more than one-quarter of all companies worldwide have found themselves victims of targeted attacks. Recovery from a single targeted attack averages up to a million dollars. That is a very rough estimate; the actual costs vary by industry and region. In reality, both the number of victims and the cost of recovery could be much higher, because in many cases these attacks are carried out covertly and discovered much later than they actually occur.
These types of threats are called “targeted” because the attacker first conducts research about the target, identifying hardware — which computers are used — and installed software. Then the attacker looks into the arsenal of instruments available to penetrate this specific ecosystem (for example, exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities), and either uses readily available tools or compiles specific ones using (rather long) lists of libraries, many of which are legitimate by themselves. This makes such an attack hard to detect, especially in the early stages of penetration, when no malicious activity is seen at all.
