The security expert Andrea Micalizzi, also known as “rgod,”, has discovered a serious vulnerability in BitTorrent Sync (CVE-2015-2846) can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The severity of the vulnerability has been rated as “high, in order to exploit the flaw the attacker have to trick the victim into visiting a malicious page or opening a specially crafted file. BitTorrent Sync is a proprietary peer-to-peer file synchronization application developed by BitTorrent, Inc. firm, it allows users to sync files between local or remote devices using on P2P protocol.

In August 2014, BitTorrent reported that BitTorrent Sync had more than 10 million installations, in November of the same year Andrea Micalizzi reported the flaw to BitTorrent through the HP’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
“This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of BitTorrent Sync. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The vulnerability relates to how BitTorrent Sync handles URLs with the btsync protocol. By navigating the user to a specially formed link starting with btsync:, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line parameters that will be passed to BTSync.exe. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current user.” reported an advisory published by ZDI.

It is important to highlight that issue was identified in November 2014 and that security experts at BitTorrent addressed and fixed the issue within the week. I reached one of the members of the team that fixed the flaw that confirmed me that security remains the top priority for the company.
Numerous products are affected by the vulnerability in the BitTorrent Sync, including solutions from DELL, HP, IBM, Novell, IBM, Oracle, Rockwell Automation, Samsung, Schneider Electric and HP.
