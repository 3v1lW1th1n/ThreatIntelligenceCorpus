					The website of the Hungarian Government temporarily shut by cyberattack					
The Hungarian Government announced that its computer network was targeted by a major cyber attack that temporarily blocked the access to several websites.
The attacks hit the main Hungarian government website and many other sites, including the one belonging to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
According to the Hungarian official, the cyber attacks were launched by threat actors from outside the country.

Government experts revealed that more than more than 62,000 cyber attacks have hit its systems in a single day.
The Hungarian Interior Ministry declared that Government experts had been able to restore access to the affected websites.
As usually happens in these cases, the attribution of the attack is very hard.
At the time I was writing there aren’t other news of the attacks.
Stay tuned.
