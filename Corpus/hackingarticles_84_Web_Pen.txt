XVWA is a badly coded web application written in PHP/MySQL that helps security enthusiasts to learn application security. It’s not advisable to host this application online as it is designed to be “Xtremely Vulnerable”. We recommend hosting this application in local/controlled environment and sharpening your application security ninja skills with any tools of your own choice. It’s totally legal to break or hack into this. The idea is to evangelize web application security to the community in possibly the easiest and fundamental way. Learn and acquire these skills for good purpose.
XVWA is designed to understand following security issues.

Now Extract XVWA lab setup in the location” C:\xampp\htdocs\” as is shown below and change the name of folder as xvwa.

Open folder xvwa to access its config file. Then open the php file” config” for configuration of xvwa to make it run on localhost server.

Here you need to make several changes in given below screenshot of config file.

Remove “/var/www/html” from XVWA_WEBROOT; remove “xvwa” under dbname; replace “localhost” from “127.0.0.1” then save the php file without changing its name at same location. Get more help from given screeshot of “config” after making above changes.
