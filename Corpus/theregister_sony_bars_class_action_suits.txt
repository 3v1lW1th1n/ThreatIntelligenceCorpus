After hack nightmare, Sony bars lawsuits with new TOS
After getting the pants sued off it for security breaches that exposed personal information connected to more than 100 million online accounts, Sony is requiring subscribers to waive their right to wage class-action lawsuits for almost any reason.
Sony dropped the bombshell in an updated terms of service and user agreement (PDF) on one of its websites. It requires people with accounts on Sony's PlayStation Network or other online services to seek binding arbitration with an arbitrator of the company's choosing instead of exercising their right to have a judge or jury hear their case. Legal claims can only be filed if the dispute isn't resolved through arbitration in a timely manner.
The terms go on to state:
Sony subscribers will be required to agree to the terms the next time they sign into their accounts - effective Thursday - if they want to continue using the online services.
The changes come five months after an attack on the PlayStation Network exposed names, addresses, email addresses, passwords, and other sensitive data for 77 million accounts. Sony shuttered the service for 40 days while it cleaned up the mess. In the weeks following, attacks were found to hit Sony Online Entertainment, the company's computer games service, and the Sony Pictures website, exposing personal information for 25 million more accounts.
In July Sony's insurance company filed a lawsuit that argued its policy didn't apply to a raft of class-action lawsuits filed in response to the high-profile security breaches.
The terms of service give subscribers the ability of opt out of the class action require, but it will require them to do something many probably haven't done in years, if ever – write a letter on paper and send it to an address using the postal service.
