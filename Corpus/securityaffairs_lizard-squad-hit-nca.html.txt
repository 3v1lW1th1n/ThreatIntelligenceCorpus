Hackers have coordinated a cyber attack against the website of the National Crime Agency (NCA) in revenge for the arrests of six teenagers that have used the DDoS tool (Lizard Stresser) offered for sale by the Lizard Squad team.
The Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for the hack by Twitting the following message:
“Stressed out? http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/ #offline.”

At the time I was writing the NCA websites is live again and there are no other details on the attack, the unique certainty is that the website was unresponsive since Tuesday morning.

The NCA arrested the teenagers as part of the Operation Vivarium conducted to hit the members of the Lizard Squad and its clients that run the denial-of-service (DDoS) tool to hit websites.
The NCA hasn’t provided the name of the teenagers, the information shared by law enforcement is the age and the residence of the suspects.
Other two teenagers arrested early this year are a 17-year-old from Cardiff and a 17-year-old from Northolt, north-west London.
The investigators clarified that none of the teenagers are believed to be a member of the Lizard Squad, neither was involved in the attacks that hit Sony and Microsoft last year.
However Lizard Squad declared that none of its members was arrested during the operations conducted by the law enforcement and announced an imminent return
“we’re going to start operations back up again” and told followers to “expect more soon“.
The NCA hasn’t issued any official communication.
