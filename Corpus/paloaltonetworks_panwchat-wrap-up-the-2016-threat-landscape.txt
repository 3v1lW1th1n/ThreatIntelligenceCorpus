#PANWchat Wrap-Up: The 2016 Threat Landscape

Last week we hosted the first ever Unit 42 Twitter chat with several of our Unit 42 experts, including Ryan Olson (@ireo), Jen Miller Osborn (@jadefh), Robert Falcone (@r0bf4lc), and Bryan Lee (@obiwanblee). The chat, “Sure Things and Long Shots, A Look at the 2016 Threat Landscape,” tackled questions from the biggest shifts in the threat landscape to the most effective measures to protect against those threats, and the best ways people can protect themselves in 2016.
The #PANWchat also served as the official launch of the new @Unit42_Intel Twitter handle, which moderated yesterday’s chat. Make sure to follow @Unit42_Intel for the latest from our Unit 42 team.
Take a look at some of the highlights from the chat below or catch up on the entire conversation through the #PANWchat hashtag. And be sure to check out our ongoing series of predictions for 2016!
