Leaking fish tank
When it comes to the Internet of Things, security still lags behind ingenuity. Among its connected devices are a fair few unknowns. And practice shows that IoT threats have a nasty habit of catching users with their pants down, so to speak. Our agenda today features another seemingly harmless contraption.


A short while back, a US casino installed a “smart” fish tank in the lobby. The fish feeding schedule, plus salt and temperature levels, were regulated automatically. The thermostat could warn the owner online if the water got too hot or cold.
The device was hidden behind a VPN, clearly to shield it from intruders. But that proved insufficient — the seemingly innocuous thermostat provided a backdoor to other nodes in the local network.


It transpired that the double-dealing fish tank had sent 10GB of data to somewhere in Norway. Internet security staff struggled to work out what information had fallen into the hands of the faceless hackers. The answer was the casino’s database of high rollers. Open sources do not specify what precise information it contained, but whether it’s just names or, more seriously, contact information and even credit-card numbers, the reputational damage is incalculable. The name of the casino was not publicized, but it was obliged to report the incident to victims of the leak.
