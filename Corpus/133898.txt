ThreatList: 6-Year-Old Dorkbot Banking Malware Resurfaces as Big ThreatThe banking malware called Dorkbot is back. Samples of the 6-year-old malware are now ranked the second biggest banking malware headache in 2018 so far, according to new data from Check Point.“Dorkbot, known malware that dates back to 2012, has entered back the top ranks, starring in the APAC [as the] top banking malware and also ranked second in the Americans, in the EMEA and globally,” wrote Check Point in its 2018 malware trends report, released Thursday.In its heyday, Dorkbot was used by attackers to target Skype, Facebook and Twitter users.
