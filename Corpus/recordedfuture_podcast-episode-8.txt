Military Meets Commercial Threat Intelligence
By Amanda McKeon on May 30, 2017
Throughout the history of conflict, threat intelligence has played a vital role in the military. Its arts, tradecraft, and organizing principles have been honed for millennia and have adapted to emerging threats, like those we face in cyber space today. 
As commercial organizations confront the mounting challenges of cyber security, they too have begun to create their own threat intelligence teams. So how do these new commercial teams compare to their military counterparts? 
In this episode, we talk to Alexi Phillipson, a former U.S. Naval Officer, and now a Customer Success Consultant at Recorded Future. Alexi served in counter-terrorism analytical roles, and his postings included the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. He now finds himself “parachuting in” to advise the many varieties of commercial threat intelligence teams, and shares with us the differences he sees, lessons learned, and some important things for teams to think about as they help their companies mitigate the increasing risks they face every day in cyber space.
