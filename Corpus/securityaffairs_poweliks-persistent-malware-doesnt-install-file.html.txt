The malware analysts consider Poweliks a very complex code which use several code layers to hide itself from prying eyes, it is able to survive without any file creation and this circumstance makes it very insidious, he performs every operation in memory and maintain persistence through a smart use of the Windows registry.
No doubts that we will see many other malware like Poweliks in the next future.
