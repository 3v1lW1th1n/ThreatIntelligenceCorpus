RFID is improving


The main problem of RFID technology has been security since they came out. Making an encrypted communication between RFID and RFID's reader was too much power expensive for a single chip. RFID keeps its own power from electromagnetism spread by readers and uses it to make some easy computation. The available power is not enough to compute heavy counts , the chip may reboot before all operations ended. An important point to make this technology useful for our future it's making a safe communication between chip and reader, in such way the hypothetical attacker cannot modify the RFID data. Doing that means developing a software able to perform heavy calculus using few operations, saving power. Kevin Fu, assistant professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote the ground to make it possible. Today I suggest this reading
