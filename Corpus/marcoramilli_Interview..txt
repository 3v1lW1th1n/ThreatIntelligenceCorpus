Interview.


Some days ago "Il Resto Del Carlino" interviewed me."Il Resto Del Carlino" is  an italian daily newspaper, which was interested on my experience on Computer Science Security. It was my first interview: awesome: Photographer, Journalist, paper and pencil, everything like old movies. The interview was pretty long and difficult, it was the first time, ever, that people didn't understand what I was saying... My technical language is very different from journalist' one. Nice Experience, amazing.Today the newspaper is out, actually I'm embarrassed but happy :D.Once again, a very nice experience.PS: the photo on the newspaper is very bad .. I feel to look better than the picture on newspaper.
