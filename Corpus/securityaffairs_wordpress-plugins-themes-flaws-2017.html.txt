					WordPress plugins and themes vulnerabilities statistics for 2017					
We added 221 vulnerabilities to our database. The total number of vulnerabilities decreased by 69%. During 2017, just like in 2016, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) has been at the top of the list. More and more WordPress plugins and themes are found to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This is because many developers do not pay enough attention to escaping data output.
2017 has also seen a substantial rise in SQL Injection vulnerabilities. It’s surprising how many sites were put in danger by vulnerabilities found in WordPress plugins. The total number of active installs is 17,101,300+.
