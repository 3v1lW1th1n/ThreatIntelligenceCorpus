The Sony PlayStation 4 is considered one of the most protected platform, since now it was impossible to run pirated games, but a hacker who calls himself CTurt claimed to develop a fully jailbroken version of the PlayStation 4 with the help of a kernel exploit that he previously created.

CTurt exploited the hack in PlayStation 4 v1.76 to inject malicious code in the PS4 and gain control of the gaming platform.
“Just broke WebKit process out of a FreeBSD jail (cred->cr_prison = &prison0). Guess you could say the PS4 is now officially “jailbroken” :P” states a Tweet sent by CTurt.

According to the above message, currently the exploit only works for PlayStation 4 firmware version 1.76, but the expert believes that it can be modified to work for more recent firmware.
How does it work?
According to the hacker, the jailbreak allows dumping of the Sony PlayStation 4 RAM from other processes and allows the installation of a custom firmware, which could be exploited by hackers to run homebrew applications that aren’t normally not allowed by the security restriction implemented by Sony.
“While it could take time before CTurt and other hackers are able to develop custom firmware along with the method to load it on the video game console, it should be noted that the exploit can also be taken advantage of to have the console run pirated software.” reported techtimes.com.
Clearly it the news will be confirmed we will observe a huge impact on the gaming market.
Which will be the reply of the Sony?
Obviously, the company will analyze the exploit in order to discover the vulnerabilities exploited by the hacker and fix them for the most recent version of Play Station 4 firmware.
