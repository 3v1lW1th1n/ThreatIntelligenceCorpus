Third suspect arrested over TalkTalk breach
A 20-year-old Staffordshire man has become the third person to be arrested in connection with the mammoth hack of British telco TalkTalk.
The unnamed man has been released on bail until March after he was arrested under the country's Computer Misuse Act.
He was nabbed in connection with a hack on budget telco lifting 1.2 million customer email addresses, names, and phone numbers, along with 15,000 dates of birth, and 28,0000 partial credit and debit cards.
Two teenagers were arrested in connection with the case last month. A 15-year-old from Northern Ireland was pinched on 26 October from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Metropolitan Police Cyber Crime Unit detectives.
A 16-year-old from London was arrested 30 October.
Customers wanting to leave the popped telco will need to have had money stolen on or after 21 October as a result of the hack, and have contacted the fraud department.
TalkTalk says it is not accepting liability for other possible expenses customers may have to bear as a result of the breach. ®
