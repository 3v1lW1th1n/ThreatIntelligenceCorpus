Galaga Post-It Note Fighter


By Brad Antoniewicz.

This month's arts and crafts project was to create a Galaga fighter out of Post-It notes! Its not a complete replica since we could only find those tiny rectangle post-its and we didnt have the best colors to go off of, but I think we did it justice :)
