Weekly Threat Intelligence Brief: February 21, 2018
This weekly brief highlights the latest threat intelligence news to provide insight into the latest threats to various industries.
“The Renewables Consulting Group (RCG) and cybersecurity specialist Cylance have published a report on cybersecurity concerns for renewable energy companies, urging them to assess and update their IT infrastructure. According to the report, there are two kinds of risk posed to companies. The first covers physical damage, as the often-remote locations of renewable energy assets mean it is difficult for damage to fences, locks and CCTV systems to be quickly repaired. Furthermore, ‘maloperation’ of machinery by hackers, forcibly making machines perform tasks that are wasteful or damaging to themselves, is named as another key threat. The second type of risk involves dangers posed to software and internet connectivity. The report states that ‘multiple wind and solar farms are now controlled from great distances away from the sites themselves’, control that is often exerted through public IP addresses, which can leave operations, maintenance and monitoring software open to attack.”

“Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizers confirmed that the Games had fallen victim to a cyber-attack during its opening ceremony, but they refused to reveal the source. The Games’ systems, including the internet and television services, were affected by the hack but organizers said it had not compromised any critical part of their operations. “Maintaining secure operations is our purpose,” said an International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesman. Asked if organizers knew who was behind the attack, the spokesman said: “I certainly don’t know. But best international practice says that you don’t talk about an attack.””

“Unknown hackers stole 339.5 million roubles ($6 million) from a Russian bank last year in an attack using the SWIFT international payments messaging system, the Russian central bank said. The disclosure, buried at the bottom of a central bank report on digital thefts in the Russian banking sector, is the latest in a string of attempted and successful cyber heists using fraudulent wire-transfer requests.  The central bank said it had been sent information about “one successful attack on the work place of a SWIFT system operator.” “The volume of unsanctioned operations as a result of this attack amounted to 339.5 million roubles,” the bank said. After the report’s publication, a central bank spokesman said hackers had taken control of a computer at a Russian bank and used the SWIFT system to transfer the money to their own accounts. The spokesman declined to name the bank or provide further details.”

“TechCrunch has learned of a potentially serious new bug affecting a wide range of Apple devices. During their development work on an international news feed, software engineers at Aloha Browser discovered two Unicode symbols in a non-English language that can crash any Apple device that uses Apple’s default San Francisco font. The bug instigates crashes on iPhones, iPads, Macs and even Watch OS devices that display text containing the symbol on their screens. When one of the two symbols is displayed in an app, the software crashes immediately. In many cases, the app cannot be reopened and must be reinstalled. TechCrunch was able to recreate this behavior on two iPhones running an older version of iOS, one iPhone running iOS 11.2.5 and a MacBook Pro running High Sierra. TechCrunch has been in touch with Apple about the potential timeline for a software fix and will update this story accordingly. According to the team at Aloha Browser, Apple is aware of the bug and it may have been reported by another development team, as well. The bug crashes apps including Mail, Twitter, Messages, Slack, Instagram and Facebook. From our testing, it also crashed Jumpcut, a copy and paste plugin for Mac. While it initially appeared that the Chrome browser for Mac was unaffected and could safely display the symbol, it later crashed Chrome and the software would not reopen without crashing until uninstalled and reinstalled.”
