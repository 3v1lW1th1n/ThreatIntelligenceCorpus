“Last April 2015, [researchers] talked about FighterPOS, a point-of-sale (PoS) malware that was used in a one-man cybercriminal operation to steal over 22,000 unique credit card numbers and affected more than 100 PoS terminals in Brazil and other countries. [Researchers] recently came across new and seemingly improved versions of this malware. Among other things, FighterPOS now has propagation capabilities; meaning, it could spread from one PoS malware terminal to another that is connected to the same network and thereby increasing the number of potential victims in one organization.”

Novetta, Kaspersky Lab, AlienVault, and Symantec published reports on Wednesday on the activities of an actor they have dubbed the Lazarus Group. As part of what they callOperation Blockbuster, researchers from these companies have analyzed more than 45 malware families, which has allowed them to find connections between several major attacks and tie them to a single group.”
