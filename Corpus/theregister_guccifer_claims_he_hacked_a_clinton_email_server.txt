Jailed hacker 'Guccifer' claims Hillary server gave him spillery
Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar – aka “Guccifer” – has had a chat to Fox News from a Virginia jail to claim he waltzed through an e-mail server run for Hillary Clinton.
He's told Fox his breach of Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal's AOL account gave him enough information to identify the Clinton server, which he then scanned and breached in 2013: all he needed was to identify the originating server from mail headers.
One thing that appears odd to The Register, however, is that while the Clinton private e-mail server that's caused all the trouble was the one she used as Secretary of State, Lazar seems to be describing a campaign office machine. In the video, he says:
Whichever server he was rifling through, it was quite a party in there, with Lazar saying he saw “up to 10 like IPs from other parts of the world. You can get the numbers only but you can tell by the numbers the region of the world.”
Almost as if the server was receiving messages from servers all over the place.
In spite of Lazar being able to see those IPs, Fox was told the FBI's computer forensics people who are now poring over the server might not be able to see the footprints of an attack.
Guiccifer's other victims included Colin Powell and a member of the Bush family.
It's impossible at this distance, and from such scanty information, to tell whether Lazar is telling the truth. ®
