The President of United States, Barack Obama has signed an executive order that uses economic restrictions to “control” anyone that is trying to attack any American interests.
But what this exactly means? This means that if the US authorities identify an entity (personor group) that is threatening the US infrastructure and which is responsible for a security breach, then all its assets can be frozen, including bank accounts, if these assets are located in the US soil.
“Starting today, we’re giving notice to those who pose significant threats to our security or economy by damaging our critical infrastructure, disrupting or hijacking our computer networks, or stealing the trade secrets of American companies or the personal information of American citizens for profit,” said the president Obama. “From now on, we have the power to freeze their assets, make it harder for them to do business with U.S. companies, and limit their ability to profit from their misdeeds.”
The executive order explicitly refers the following case regarding possible activities that represent a threat for the Homeland security:
The executive order is efficient only if the alleged attackers have assets inside America, or do business with American companies.

The idea behind the executive order is aligned with previous orders signed Obama to punish hacking activities against US systems. President Obama already anticipated the use of economic sanctions as a deterrent against cyber attacks in the Sony Pictures case. in January 2015, Obama announced economic sanctions against North Korea in the wake of the hacks against Sony Pictures.
