Weekly Phishing Activity: October 16, 2017

This week, we saw an insignificant decrease in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we monitor. The industries that saw the largest decreases were eCommerce (>55%), Internet and Information Services (>20%), and Telecommunications (>15%).
The industries that saw the largest increases in phishing activity were: Computer Software at >175%, Computer Hardware at >45%, and Electronic Payment Systems at >40%.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
