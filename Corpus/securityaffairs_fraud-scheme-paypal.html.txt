TinKod noticed an anomalous behavior while making a transaction using PayPal back in 2010, he explained that a person was trying to scam him with his money using the same chargeback process.
Once noticed the attempt of scam and to avoid paying charges, he transferred all his money from his temporary account to his another real PayPal account. After a month, when he checked is Paypal balance he noticed that it was negative.
“A Chargeback, also known as a reversal, occurs when a buyer asks a credit card company to reverse a transaction that has already cleared” and this could be done when the buyer’s credit card number is stolen and used fraudulently or if seller tries to fraud.” said TinKode.
TinKode demonstrated to the PayPal security team the presence of a loophole in PayPal service which allows any user to double its amount endlessly. Following the description provided as proof of concept by using three separate PayPal account with one real and other two verified using Virtual Credit Card (VCC) and Virtual Bank Account (VBA).
