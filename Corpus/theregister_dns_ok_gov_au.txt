Oz launches DNSChanger testing site
Australia's government has created a website which detects the presence, or otherwise, of DNSChanger, a nasty piece of malware which the sites says “... changes a user's Domain Name System (DNS) settings, enabling criminals to direct unsuspecting internet users to fraudulent websites and otherwise interfere with their web browsing.”
“It has been associated with 'click fraud', the installation of additional malware and other malicious activities,” the site adds.
The hiply-named www.dns-ok.gov.au does what it says on the can: load up the site and you'll be told whether or not the malware lurks within your system and if, ergo, your DNS is okay. If you are infected, the site urges you to do something about it before the FBI switches off its kludge fix that stops the malware from doing it's worst. ®
