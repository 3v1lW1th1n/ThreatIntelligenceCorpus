Kaspersky: Freemasons coded fake malware in the Bermuda Triangle
Eugene Kaspersky has taken to his blog to make another stinging rebuttal of a Reuters report that alleged the company that bears his name deliberately sabotaged rival antivirus packages.
“The Reuters story is based on information provided by anonymous former KL employees. And the accusations are complete nonsense, pure and simple,” Kaspersky wrote in a post that opens by saying it's possible to determine who killed JFK, learn who controls the the Bermuda Triangle and divine the true purposes of the Freemasons if one cites anonymous sources.
Kaspersky then goes on to offer his version of events, that opens “In 2012-2013, the anti-malware industry suffered badly because of serious problems with false positives.”
Kaspersky Lab, and others, found “someone … spreading legitimate software laced with malicious code targeting specifically the antivirus engines of many companies.”
The problem was first noticed in November 2012 when “... our products produced false positives on several files that were in fact legitimate. These were the Steam client, Mail.ru game center, and QQ client. An internal investigation showed that these incidents occurred as the result of a coordinated attack by an unknown third party.”
New and slightly-tweaked versions of those applications had been an irritant to the AV community for months, Kaspersky wrote, so in 2013 the industry staged a “a closed-door meeting among leading cybersecurity and other software industry players that also suffered from the attack – as well as vendors that were not affected by the problem but were aware of it.”
“During that meeting the participants exchanged information about the incidents, tried to figure out the reasons behind them, and worked on an action plan. Unfortunately no breakthrough occurred, though some interesting theories regarding attribution were expressed.
Among those theories was the notion that an AV company could be doing the deed. Kaspersky says that's a ridiculous idea and that “As far back as the late nineties I’d take with me to press conferences a placard with the word ‘No!’ on it. It saved me so much time. I’d just point to it when every third question was: 'Do you write viruses yourselves, for your product to then “cure” the infections?'
“Do they really think an 18+ year-old business built 100% on trust would be doing such things?” he asks in the post?
Clearly, Reuters does think just that. But only, anonymous sources tell us, because the Illuminati told it to. ®
