Forensics analyst4 (tie). Incident response, incident handler4 (tie). Security architect6. Vulnerability researcher7 (tie). Network security engineer10 (tie). CISO/ISO or director of sec10 (tie). Application penetration testerWhy it’s cool: “You’re an 'ethical hacker'. “It takes equal parts technical ability and creativity,” “Combines applying different thought processes to system analysis with exploration tools, and a sort of dangerous level of knowledge.”
