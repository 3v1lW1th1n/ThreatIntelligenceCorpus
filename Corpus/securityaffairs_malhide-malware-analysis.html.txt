					MalHide Malware uses the compromised system as an eMail relay					
From C2 comes actions, victims addresses, SMTP servers, and passwords. The sample connects to a given SMTP relays, it authenticates itself and sends email to the victims. The following images prove that the attackers have plenty of credentials to SMTP relays around the globe.
Following few examples of the sent emails coming from C2 and delivering through the analyzed MalHide sample.
Here we are, another email has been sent, another Malware has been thought and developed, another analysis I’ve been made but this time it looks like the “Malware economy” is seriously moving to fraud, there is much money respect to information stealing which is an ancient and romantic way to attack victims. Is this attack a significative example expressing the will of the new underground economy? Is this attack a small and silent change of paradigm, where previously the attacker was interested in your data in order to sell them but now he gets more interested on fraud third parties (such as companies) through you? I do not have such answer here.
Ok, now it’s time to explain why I called this Malware MalHide. Well, it’s a complex Malware, it hides several times BUT most important it has been developed to hide the attacker from sending emails in a way that is not possible to trace back the Attacker IP from the attack path. So I believe MalHide would be a nice name

I am a computer security scientist with an intensive hacking background. I do have a MD in computer engineering and a PhD on computer security from University of Bologna. During my PhD program I worked for US Government (@ National Institute of Standards and Technology, Security Division) where I did intensive researches in Malware evasion techniques and penetration testing of electronic voting systems.
 
I do have experience on security testing since I have been performing penetration testing on several US electronic voting systems. I’ve also been encharged of testing uVote voting system from the Italian Minister of homeland security. I met Palantir Technologies where I was introduced to the Intelligence Ecosystem. I decided to amplify my cyber security experiences by diving into SCADA security issues with some of the most biggest industrial aglomerates in Italy. I finally decided to found Yoroi: an innovative Managed Cyber Security Service Provider developing some of the most amazing cyber security defence center I’ve ever experienced ! Now I technically lead Yoroi defending our customers strongly believing in: Defence Belongs To Humans
