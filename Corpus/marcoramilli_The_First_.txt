The First Time Against Calling Conventions


This morning I've been fascinated by a non standard "Calling Convention" Function. Usually I play with cdecl (C calling convention), stdcall (the Microsoft standard calling convention) or from time to time I've also exploited some fastcall (fast calling convention) but I've never seen something like that:


 arg_0           = dword ptr  8
 arg_4           = byte ptr  0Ch
                 push    ebp
                 mov     ebp, esp
                 mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_0]
                 lea     eax, [ebp+arg_4]
                 push    eax             ; va_list
                 push    ecx             ; char *
                 push    esi             ; size_t
                 push    edi             ; char *
                 call    __vsnprintf
                 add     esp, 10h
                 mov     byte ptr [edi+esi-1], 0
                 pop     ebp
                 retn

Variable in eax, ecx, esi and edi ? What's kind of convention is this?
