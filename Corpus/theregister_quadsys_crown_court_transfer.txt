Quadsys Five fraud case transferred to Crown Court
A case involving the owner and certain employees at security reseller Quadsys, who were last month charged with fraud by Thames Valley Police, is to be elevated to Crown Court.
As we revealed last month, the Quadsys Five, including owner Paul Streeter, MD Paul Cox, director Alistair Barnard, account manager Steve Davies and in-house security solutions consultant Jon Townsend, were indicted by the boys in blue.
In addition to the conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation charge levelled at the five, Cox was also placed in the frame for the offence of blackmail.
The individuals were yesterday due to appear at Banbury Magistrates Court but Townsend was a no show: he is understood to be on holiday.
The court confirmed that Cox, Barnard, Davies and Streeter’s offences were “indictable only” – meaning no plea was taken – and the case “adjourned” to Oxford Crown Court until 28 September.
Townsend will be required to appear at Banbury Magistrates Court on 14 September, as no plea has yet been received, the court clerk confirmed.
It is alleged the Quadsys five hacked into a rival reseller to pilfer information on the database, including client details and pricing stats. They were arrested in March by TVP, in a joint operation with the National Crime Agency and the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit.
The Oxfordshire-based security outfit – a Sophos and Kaspersky Gold partner – boasts some pretty high-profile clients, including Leeds United FC, Derry City Council, South Tyne and Wear Primary Care Trust and the private Cokethorpe School.
The Quadsys individuals were not available to comment. ®
