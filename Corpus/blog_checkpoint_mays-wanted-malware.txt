May’s Most Wanted Malware:  Cryptomining Malware Digs into Nearly 40% of Organizations Globally
Check Point’s latest Global Threat Index reveals that the Coinhive cryptominer impacted 22% of organizations, increasing by nearly 50% in May 2018 
 
Crypto-mining malware has shown no signs of slowing its dominance, as the impact of the Coinhive cyptominer increased by nearly 50% during the month, affecting 22% of all organizations around the world —  up from 16% in April.
 
May 2018 marked the fifth consecutive month where cryptomining malware dominated Check Point’s Top Ten Most Wanted Malware Index. Coinhive retained the top spot as the most prevalent malware as another crypto-mining malware, Cryptoloot, ranked second with a global reach of 11%.
 
Impacting an entire nearly 40% of the globe, cryptomining continues to be highly prevalent as attackers are clearly finding this technique profitable. In turn, enterprises must employ a multi-layered cybersecurity strategy that protects against both established malware families cyber-attacks and brand new threats – or their networks will get exploited by cryptomining and other types of attack.
 
Check Point’s researchers also reported that cyber-criminals are continuing to target unpatched server vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 (CVE-2017-7269) and Oracle Web Logic (CVE-2017-10271) when targeting business networks. Globally, 44% of the world’s organizations were targeted for the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 vulnerability, 40% were impacted by the Oracle Web Logic vulnerability, while a further 17% were affected by SQL injection.
 
Cyber-criminals will always look for the easiest way in to a network – as much as they develop new attack vectors, they’re just as likely to simply probe for known vulnerabilities. As such, it is vital that organizations apply patches for known vulnerabilities when they are made available. With nearly half the world’s organizations affected by these vulnerabilities, it goes to show that security basics – such as patching – are critical to ensuring that networks remain secure.

Check Point’s Global Threat Impact Index and its ThreatCloud Map is powered by Check Point’s ThreatCloud intelligence, the largest collaborative network to fight cybercrime which delivers threat data and attack trends from a global network of threat sensors. The ThreatCloud database holds over 250 million addresses analyzed for bot discovery, more than 11 million malware signatures and over 5.5 million infected websites, and identifies millions of malware types daily.
