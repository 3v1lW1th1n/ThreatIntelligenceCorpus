Chrome update plugs hush-hush browser hole
Google has pushed out a new version of its browser that protects against a critical vulnerability as well as fixing some stability snags.
Version 2.0.172.33 of Chrome patches a severe flaw involving how the browser handles particular responses from HTTP servers. The security bug creates a buffer overflow risk, implying it opens a potential means for hackers to inject hostile code onto vulnerable systems. Google is holding off on details in order to give punters a chance to download the update.
A pair of other stability and security issues are also tackled by the latest version of the browser, including potential browser crash problems when loading some secure (HTTPS) sites, as explained in Google's release notes here.
The update marks the second time in two weeks that Google has updated its browser software. The previous revised version, released on 9 June, addressed two flaws involving the WebKit application framework that powers the open-source browser.
Browser security updates - in general - are becoming more frequent. Partially in response to this issue, security notification firm Secunia released a new version of its Personal Software Inspector tool on Wednesday. PSI version 1.5 of the free-of-charge (to consumers) software adds the ability to scan for browser or browser plug-in security holes, as explained by Secunia here. ®
