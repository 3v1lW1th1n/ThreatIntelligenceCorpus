Research.


Hi Folks today I wanna share with you a deep and touching thought that I've heard from Marc Hebert  (An anthropologist from Florida) about Research.Today he said something like:" .... if we ask people what they want, they would say: We want another horse... Research gave to them a car...."Such thought made me thinking about what is going on research nowadays. Governments cut and cut funding to Research (I hope) without knowing that research will give us the "next car" ..  I think it is pretty sad. So thank you Marc and thank you to all of us that even if bad paid are still doing research.
