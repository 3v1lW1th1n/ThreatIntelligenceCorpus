Growing up with virtualisation
On Demand As many organisations are discovering as they move beyond server virtualisation pilot projects, there's more to it than just consolidating servers and dealing with workloads.
In this on-demand webcast, Jon Collins of analyst firm Freeform Dynamics talks to Zane Adam, general manager of virtualisation and systems management at Microsoft, to consider two very important aspects of virtualisation: the role of IT management best practice, and some specific questions around how to secure the virtualised environment.
So if you're interested in understanding more about how to manage virtualised server estates and whether it offers a path towards more dynamic IT delivery, or if you are concerned about the eggs-in-one-basket risks of virtualising both existing and new workloads, then tune in here.
