Free Huge Password Dictionary


Today I wanna share a huge work done during last years, just because traveling a lot it has been very useful, you know WPA2 was the main target, but you can really use it in a lot of different ways. It seems that is very difficult to find a good and free password dictionary around internet, for some of them you have to pay, for some others you need to wait long time on torrents on P2P.. So finally I decided to share my personal one :D, on RapidShare. There still is a lot to do with this huge password  dictionary (I'm thinking on optimization and upgrading ), so if someone of you interested in that want to upgrade or to optimize the dictionary I'll be very glad. If you are planning to modify it, please let me know in such way I'll upgrade the RapidShare files, having an always upgraded Free Password Dictionary Repository.Here the link to download the Free Password Dictionary:1)Free Huge Password Dictionary 12)Free Huge Password Dictionary 23)Free Huge Password Dictionary 34)Free Huge Password Dictionary 45)Free Huge Password Dictionary 56)Free Huge Password Dictionary 67)Free Huge Password Dictionary 78)Free Huge Password Dictionary 89)Free Huge Password Dictionary 910)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1011)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1112)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1213)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1314)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1415)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1516)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1617)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1718)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1819)Free Huge Password Dictionary 1920)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2021)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2122)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2223)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2324)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2425)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2526)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2627)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2728)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2829)Free Huge Password Dictionary 2930)Free Huge Password Dictionary 3031)Free Huge Password Dictionary 3132)Free Huge Password Dictionary 3233)Free Huge Password Dictionary 3334)Free Huge Password Dictionary 3435)Free Huge Password Dictionary 3536)Free Huge Password Dictionary 3637)Free Huge Password Dictionary 37Ok, after you downloaded all the zip files in a folder (let's say DictionaryFolder) you can unify the files, making the HugePasswordDictionary file, simply using the cat command.cat x* >> MyHugePasswordDictionary.txtIf you wanna use the "MyHugePasswordDictionary.txt" with aircrack-ng, you need to slipt it into little 2MB files. To do that you can simply use the split Unix command like the follow example.split -b 2m MyHugePasswordDictionary.txtAt the end of the process you'll find several 2MB files inside your "DictionaryFolder" directory.Enjoy  !
