The OpenSSL Project has released an update for the 1.1.0 branch (OpenSSL 1.1.0c) to fix a number of vulnerabilities. One of the issues solved with the update is the high severity denial-of-service (DoS) flaw CVE-2016-7054 that was reported by Robert Święcki from the Google Security Team.
The CVE-2016-7054 vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow related to TLS connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 cipher suites.
“TLS connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS.” reads the advisory published Openssl.org.
The flaw could be triggered corrupting larger payloads, a circumstance that leads to a DoS condition due to the crash of OpenSSL.
The OpenSSL Project confirmed the flaw does not affect versions prior to 1.1.0.

The OpenSSL 1.1.0c also patches the following vulnerabilities:
I remind you that that version 1.0.1 version will no longer be supported after December 31, 2016.
“As per our previous announcements and our Release Strategy (https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html), support for OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 will cease on 31st December 2016. No security updates for that
version will be provided after that date. Users of 1.0.1 are advised to
upgrade.” continues the advisory. Support for versions 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 ended on 31st December 2015. Those versions are no longer receiving security updates.”
