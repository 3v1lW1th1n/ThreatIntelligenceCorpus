					Cryptolulz666 hacked the Dutch Chamber of Commerce in HK					
The hacker @Cryptolulz666, with a little help from the colleague Kapustkiy, has broken into the website of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (http://www.dutchchamber.hk/).
The hacker accessed data belonging to around 200 users, but he decided to leak only half of them as proof of the hack.
Cryptolulz666 told me he exploited a SQL injection vulnerability affecting the website.
A few days ago, he hacked “The Standard Hong Kong” newspaper, he confirmed me that his choice is not casual, he wants to target organizations in Hong kong.
“Yes … As you seen in the previous hack I chose a big corporation in Hong kong and I succeded… this time also chose Hong Kong because I want to make an impact on this country.” he told me. ” no country is safe”
He highlighted the fact that a silly flaw like a SQL Injection could have serious consequences if admins ignore the pillars of security.
Data leaked on Pastebin includes data related to companies working with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.

Cryptolulz ( @Cryptolulz666) is a former member of the Powerful Greek Army, who hacked several government websites, including the one of the Russian embassy of Armenia (www.embassyru.am).
He also launched DDoS attacks against the website http://italiastartupvisa.mise.gov.it/ belonging to the Italian Government and the website of the Russian Federal Drug Control Service liquidation commission.
