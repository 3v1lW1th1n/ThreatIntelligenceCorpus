					Data breach notification website LeakedSource raided by feds					
The Data breach notification website LeakedSource has apparently been raided by feds. The service is one of the most important available online, it reported some of the largest data breaches last year and now is facing a serious problem.
Among the data breaches reported by LeakedSource there are the ones that affected Last.fm, Rambler.ru, FriendFinder Networks, LinkedIn, and MySpace.
According to a post on the marketplace ogflip.com, the owner of LeakedSource was raided earlier this week, it is still unclear the reason for the raid.
At the time I was writing the service appears to have been shut down.
“Leakedsource is down forever and won’t be coming back. Owner raided early this morning. Wasn’t arrested, but all SSD’s got taken, and Leakedsource servers got subpoena’d and placed under federal investigation. If somehow he recovers from this and launches LS again, then I’ll be wrong. But I am not wrong. (sic)” reads the message from OGF.

The data breach notification service was offering access to the full archive with the payment of a membership fee.
LeakedSource indexed more than 3 billion records that were obtained through information sharing between a number of sources, including the hackers who broke in the compromise archives.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not comment the news of an alleged investigation related to the data breach notification service.
