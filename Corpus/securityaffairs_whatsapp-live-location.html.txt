					WhatsApp will allow to Revoke Sent Messages and Track Friends Live Location					
What’s app is working to improve user’s experience introducing new features, in particular, today I’ll speak about two of them about the possibility to track friends location and also to revoke sent messages.
Yes, you will be able to recall a sent message you the recipient hasn’t read it, it seems in fact that this is one of the most requested features. Despite the feature was not announced by the company, it was first reported by a Twitter account @WABetaInfo, it may be included in one of the forthcoming version of WhatsApp, likely in a beta release.

The Revoke option isn’t the unique feature that will be introduced soo in WhatsApp, the company is also testing a new feature called “Live Location.” It was thought for group chats in order to allow users to track the location of the friends in the same group.

When the user will enable the Live Location Tracking feature, other members in a group will be to track their location in real time. According to THN, the feature could be enabled for a specific interval of time.
“WhatsApp’s Live Location Tracking feature will allow users to enable other members in a group to track their location in real time. The feature will be built on WhatsApp’s send your location feature, and users can opt in the feature to share their moving position for one, two or five minutes or indefinitely.” reads THN.
