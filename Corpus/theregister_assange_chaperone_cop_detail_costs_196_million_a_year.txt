Assange's cop chaperones have cost £10 MEEELLION to date
Blighty has haemorrhaged A$19.6 million (£10 million, US$15.3 million) on the security detail guarding platinum-topped Wikileaks boss Julian Assange during his stay at the Ecuador embassy in London.
The figures cover the cost of keeping 343 bobbies on the beat from the time of Assange's self-imposed exile to October 2014 and were revealed in a freedom of information request by LBC radio station.
It showed it cost taxpayers £10,500 (US$16,000, AUD$19,000) a day to keep watch over Assange, who has now spent more than 960 days in Ecuador's London embassy as he attempts to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations.
Assange reportedly feared Sweden would extradite him to the United States where he could be questioned for his hand in the release of that country's classified diplomatic documents.
Assange's July 2014 bid to move off his Ecuadorian couch failed after a Swedish court upheld the arrest warrant against him, leaving Blighty with the bill for the arguably the most expensive couch-surfer ever. ®
