CMS Explorer-Discover the CMS components behind the site

CMS Explorer is designed to reveal the the specific modules, plugins, components and themes that various CMS driven web sites are running.  This is done by retrieving the module’s current source tree and then requesting those file names from the target system. These requests can be sent through a distinct proxy to help “bootstrap” security testing tools like Burp, Paros, Webinspect, etc.
CMS Explorer currently supports module/theme discovery with the following products:
