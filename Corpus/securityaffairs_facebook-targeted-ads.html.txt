I’m not surprised that Facebook collects data of more than a billion users exactly like any other companies, but the statement hides many pitfalls because the company will to deliver ‘targeted Ads’ on its service have to keep note of the overall user web experience.

Facebook, to provide targeted ads, needs to track every website the user visits, even if it isn’t Facebook website.
“We and our affiliates, third parties, and other partners (“partners”) use these technologies for security purposes and to deliver products, services and advertisements, as well as to understand how these products, services and advertisements are used. With these technologies, a website or application can store information on your browser or device and later read that information back.”
The defense policy will be increasingly difficult, but know who and how handles our data is crucial.
