Yesterday I presented at the ISACA Roma & OWASP Italy conference the state of the art for the Internet of Things paradigm. The presentation highlights the security and privacy issues for the Internet of Things, a technology that is changing user’s perception of the technology.
 

 

The presentation includes details of the diffusion of the Internet of Things devices, forecast on its growth and information related to the economy behind the paradigm.
An entire session explores the possible misuses (i.e. DDoS, malware, thingbot) of the Internet of Things devices analyzing threat actors and the attack techniques implemented in real cases.
Enjoy it!
