P2P Botnet Kelihos.B with 100.000 Nodes Sinkholed
This past Wednesday, CrowdStrike has teamed up with security experts from Dell SecureWorks, the Honeynet Project and Kaspersky to take out a peer-to-peer botnet which we believe is the newest offspring of a family that has been around since 2007: Kelihos.B, a successor of Kelihos, Waledac and the Storm Worm. Traditionally, the botnets in this family are known for spamming, but the newest version is also capable of stealing bitcoin wallets from infected computers. There is an infographic at the bottom of this post that contains the most important facts and numbers at one glance.
Just like its brothers, Kelihos.B relies on a self-organizing, dynamic peer-to-peer topology to make its infrastructure more resilient against takedown attempts. It further uses a distributed layer of command-and-control servers with hosts registered in countries like Sweden, Russia, and Ukraine that are in turn controlled by the botmaster. These systems can easily be replaced by others by announcing a different list of job servers to the bots. Figure 1 shows a scheme of this architecture.
 
 
 
The geographic distribution of the infected machines is somewhat unusual. With almost one quarter, Poland has by far the most infections.:
 
 
 
 
We are working with our partners to inform ISPs about infections in their network and make sure that Kelihos.B remains safely sinkholed. The command-and-control infrastructure has been abandoned by the gang that was operating the botnet two days after we started our operation. One down, many more to go…
