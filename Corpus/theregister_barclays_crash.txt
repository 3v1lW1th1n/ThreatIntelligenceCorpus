Barclays IT systems have a strop
Updated Barclays Bank is suffering an IT outage that has seen cash points refusing to pay out and online banking going offline, with some readers reporting that even fleshy-staffed branches are having problems.
The problems started over lunch time, and it seems that anyone trying to get money from a Barclays account should try and find a human to process their request. The machines are all refusing to respond and it is not known when they might return to the fold.
The online service reports "technical problems", and suggests logging in later, while those trying their luck at a cash point are being told that the machine is "unable to contact your bank" or "service unavailable", which isn't the kind of explanation that’s going to go down well with the landlord.
Branches are, we understand, able to hand over cash, though the process is tortuous, apparently involving pens, paper, and something called a cheque.
We've lodged a call with Barclays for more information, and will pass it on when we have it. But the best advice at the moment is to work out where your nearest branch is, and to check that you've got enough cash to get there. ®
Updated: Barclays called to say that the network is up and running again, with everything except on-line banking now fully operational. Punters desperate to access their accounts on-line should be able to real soon now, as they're phasing the switch on.
