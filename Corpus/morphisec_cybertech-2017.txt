Morphisec brings its team of cyber security experts to CyberTech Tel Aviv next week, January 30 to February 2. Meet the faces behind the pioneering Moving Target Defense technology that’s disrupting the endpoint security field.
Morphisec Endpoint Threat Prevention solution prevents zero-days, evasive malware, ransomware and advanced attacks in real-time – before they can do any damage. Morphisec randomly and continuously morphs the memory structure of processes, turning the attack surface into a field of unpredictable traps that snare attackers. This real-time, one-way randomization stops sophisticated advanced attacks, including file-less malware, with no false positives or business disruption.
CyberTech is known as the most significant conference and exhibition of cyber technologies outside of the United States. Look for Morphisec in the JVP Pavilion to discuss your security challenges and get a sneak peek of the newest version of the Morphisec Endpoint Threat Prevention solution!

Don’t miss Morphisec CEO Ronen Yehoshua in the closing plenary, “Next Generation Cyber Solutions” on January 31, at 5:15 pm. Yehoshua will offer his take on “NewGen” buzz and myths in a session that is sure to be as disruptive as our technology.
Hope to see you next week in Tel Aviv!
