Hack Windows 7 Password from Guest Account using 2015-1701 Exploit (Easy Way)

From Wikipedia
Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.
The result is that an application with more privileges than intended by the application developer or system administrator can perform unauthorized actions.

Now here type net user command to change the admin password but it will show you the error “Access is denied”

Download CVE 2015-1701 from here and unzip in your Pc. Then go to the compiled folder in CVE Master. Here you will find 2 exe files for 32-bit user and 64-bit user(in my case I’m using 64-bit user).

Now run Taihou64.exe, it will open a command prompt with admin priveleges. Now you can change the password using net user command. Example is given below:
Syntax:
net user (username) *   then press enter

Note: This trick works only on Windows7(all versions) not available for Windows8 and Windows10 yet.
