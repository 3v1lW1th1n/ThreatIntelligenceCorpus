Careless tweets cost lives, warns MoD
The Ministry of Defence has knocked together a couple of videos warning just how a careless tweet or unguarded Facebook comment could end up with someone on the wrong end of an AK-47.
The MoD accepts social networking sites are "great for keeping in touch with family and friends, and letting the world know what you’re up to", but cautions that "there may be those who are using such sites for unsavoury reasons".
Indeed, among the many security threats we face is the disco-dancing terrorist...
