eGOV 2011


Google Analytics says I have 84 followers from The Netherlands...To everybody who's living near Delft, The Netherlands. I am going to present a paper titled: "Exploring Information Security Issues in Public Sector Inter-Organizational Collaboration" during eGov 2011. I'll be in town from August 27 to September 2. If someone interested on security want to have a beer together while discussing about security stuff I'll be happy in meeting you. Just drop a comment or write me an email.
