Kensington secures fondleslabs and phones
Kensington extended its range of security devices to tablets and smartphones this week, with a collection of protective kit for iPhones and iPads.
First up is the BungeeAir Power, essentially a plastic iPhone 4 case that connects wirelessly to a key fob. Leave the room without your handset and the fob will vibrate, signal an alarm and lock the phone. The BungeeAir allows users to set the distance at which this happens too and if someone tries to tamper with the case the alarm and lockout routine kicks in.
The Kensington BungeeAir Power is available from major retailers and t'interweb for £100.
Meanwhile, the Kensington SecureBack is a more familiar security lock system that secures an iPad 2 to prevent theft. Without blocking any ports, speakers or cameras, the SecureBack attaches to a stationary device and lets users fix their kit in a single click.
The Kensington SecureBack starts at £45. ®
