How to Find All Website Hosted in same Server

Example: ping hackingarticles.in

Now open www.bing.com or www.yahoo.com
Type ip:IP-Address in the Bing or Yahoo search box to get the list of websites hosted on the respective IP address.
 

 

 
You Get Signal have just the tool for this. It’s called a “Reverse IP Domain Check” and it takes a site URL or IP address and tells you all or many of the domains pointing to that server.

My IP Neighbors lets you find out if any other web sites (“virtual hosts”) are hosted on a given web server. The tool is a great way to find out who your hosting neighbors are, or just to see how many other websites your hosting company runs from the same machine. Or perhaps you’d like to know if that flashy company still uses cheap hosting like the rest of us.
