Open Source Voting System


Today reading the " Understanding Open Source Application in The Voting Industries" and following some discussions on it, I found several Open Source Voting Softwares and Methodologies.1. OpenSTV2. FREE e-democracy project 3. evm4. EML Voting Project5. Verifyable Electronic Voting6. SOLON-free election program 7. electronic voting platform 8. osdv-sharp 9. Open Source Democracy 10. Secure Electronic Voting SystemSince I believe Open Source is a great development methodology to prevent Security issues, I'm going to investigate more on some of this tools, especially the number 6,7 and 10. Again, if someone of you guys, knows (in terms of "has used") these systems please let me know some impressions between them.
