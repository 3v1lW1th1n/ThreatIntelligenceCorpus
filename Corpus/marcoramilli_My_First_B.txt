My First Book.


Alright, most of my readers know that I am writing a book. That's true. It has been asked to me to write a book on security. It's a huge process, really believe me... I would never have believed in how much work it is....Yesterday on amazon.com appeared a book titled "Designing A New Electronic Voting System: Towards electronic voting systems" within my name on it. This is not the book I am talking about (as many of you emailed me). This is just an old publication of mine, that suddenly became a book ... (with my permission of course). You might say, alright Marco, so what's this blog post about? This blog post is to underline and to make public that this is not the book on security that I am preparing, so stay tuned it could appear soon ;)
