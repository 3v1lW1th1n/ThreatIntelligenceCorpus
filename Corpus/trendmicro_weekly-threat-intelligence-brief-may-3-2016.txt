In part, the notification states that, “While precision agriculture technology reduces farming costs and increases crop yields, farmers need to be aware of and understand the associated cyber risks to their data and ensure that companies entrusted to manage their data, including digital management tool and application developers and cloud service providers, develop adequate cybersecurity and breach response plans.” ”

“The attackers who stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank probably hacked into software from the SWIFT financial platform that is at the heart of the global financial system, said security researchers at British defense contractor BAE Systems.
SWIFT, a cooperative owned by 3,000 financial institutions, confirmed to Reuters that it was aware of malware targeting its client software. Its spokeswoman Natasha Deteran said SWIFT on Monday released a software update to thwart the malware, along with a special warning for financial institutions to scrutinize their security procedures.”

“A sophisticated malware, identified as “Multigrain,” has been found to steal payment card data from point-of-sale (POS) stations.
When a team of researchers at FireEye recently discovered this new type of POS malware, they found out that it had overlapping traits of a previously-known, notorious POS malware known as NewposThings. However, the new variant uses advanced techniques to steal card data; it employs digital signature to specifically target POS security terminals and exfiltrates the stolen information over Domain Name System (DNS).”

“Microsoft has been observing the activities of a cyber espionage group that has leveraged a Windows patching system in attacks aimed at organizations in South and Southeast Asia.
The APT actor, dubbed by Microsoft “Platinum,” has been active since at least 2009, primarily targeting victims via spear phishing attacks. Its activities have mainly focused on government organizations, intelligence agencies, defense institutes and ISPs, and the information stolen by the group has been used for indirect economic advantages, not for direct financial gain.”

“The Supreme Court on Thursday approved changes that would make it easier for the FBI to hack into computers, including those belonging to victims of cybercrime. The changes will take effect in December, unless Congress adopts competing legislation.
Previously, under the federal rules on criminal procedures, a magistrate judge couldn’t approve a warrant request to search a computer remotely if the investigator didn’t know where the computer was—because it might be outside his or her jurisdiction.”
