Raising Risk Awareness on the Adoption of Web 2.0 Technologies in Decision Making Processes


 Today I'd like to share a paper that Marco Prandini and I wrote on the use of Web2.0 in decision making process. The paper can be found here on the Journal of Future Internet. Abstract: In the recent past, the so-called “Web 2.0” became a powerful tool for decision making processes. Politicians and managers, seeking to improve participation, embraced this technology as if it simply were a new, enhanced version of the World Wide Web, better suited to retrieve information, opinions and feedbacks from the general public on subjects like laws, acts and policies. This approach was often naive, neglecting the less-obvious aspects of the technology, and thus bringing on significant security problems. This paper shows how, in the end, the result could easily be the opposite of what was desired. Malicious attackers, in fact, could quite easily exploit the vulnerabilities in these systems to hijack the process and lead to wrong decisions, also causing the public to lose trust in the systems themselves.  Web 2.0 is for sure a great opportunity and an amazing paradigm that could be very useful for politicians or decison makers in the more broad way. However web 2.0, as described in e paper, could be very dangerous if used to attack a decision chain. The paper describes and gives examples on how a possible attacker could attack  current political decisions by  exploiting simple and well known Web 2.0 bugs. I recommend this reading to all of you involved in politics and/ord decision making, in addition to everybody who works for government agencies.
