“Yesterday, we faced an intense, US-originated cyber attack. These attacks have been carried out systematically on different parts of the Energy Ministry, but we have repelled them all,” explained the Turkish Energy Minister in an interview with A Haber TV.
The technicians discovered sabotage of underground lines in three districts of Istanbul in concomitance of adverse weather conditions.

In a first time, the Energy Ministry reported the power outages were caused by damage to the power grid caused by the snow.
Recently, a source in the ministry confirmed to the state news agency Anadolu that the problems were also caused by cyber attacks.
“Many infiltration attempts to the systems controlling our transmission and electricity producing lines were determined and prevented. The infiltration attempts are indicators of a major sabotage preparation against Turkey’s national electricity network,” the anonymous source told the agency.
The Turkish Government continues to accuse US-based Turkish preacher Fethullah Gulen of using a wide network of supporters in Turkey to undermine the country’s stability.
Gulen denies any accusations and the US refuses to comply the Turkish request for his extradition.
Some prominent experts believe that Turkish authorities are facing with sabotage and problems to legacy infrastructure using “cyber” as a scapegoat for the situation.
