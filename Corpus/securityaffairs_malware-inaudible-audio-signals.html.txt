The paper describes is very intriguing because it incorporates the Dragos Ruiu’s allegations, it remark the principle that is possible to infect a “disconnected system” exploiting a different channel for malware propagation.
Michael Hanspach and Michael Goetz confirmed that there is no connection between their paper and badBIOS, Hanspach said their attack is feasible today because the utilized techniques are well documented.
“If we were able to come up with this research with very few people, time and budget (and with good intentions), so would be larger groups (maybe with a different intention),”  “Therefore, anyone working in a security critical context should be thinking about protection measures.” Hanspach said via email to the Threatpost.
Let’s wait for a security solution, meantime security managers of critical computing systems are advised.
