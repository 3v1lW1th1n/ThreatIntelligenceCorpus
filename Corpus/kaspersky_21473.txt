Transatlantic Cable podcast, episode 27
In this week’s edition the Transatlantic Cable podcast, Dave and I veer off of our usual script. Instead of talking about odd news that you should care about during the course of a week, this week we do a 20-ish-minute preview of the upcoming Security Analyst Summit — #TheSAS2018. We won’t, however, be playing any spoilers (our PR colleagues might not let us leave Cancún if we did).
Some of the topics we discuss include past SAS announcements, why the conference is important, and why this community is so special.
During the week, stay tuned to Kaspersky Daily, where we will have some announcements from the conference, daily podcasts recapping events, and some other goodies for you. You can also follow along at #TheSAS2018 on Twitter/Instagram or on the Kaspersky Lab social media accounts.
