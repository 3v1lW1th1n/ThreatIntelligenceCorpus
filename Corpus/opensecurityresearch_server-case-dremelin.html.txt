Server Case Dremelin'


By Brad Antoniewicz

Happy Halloween! I thought it be nice to take a break from our everyday activities and show off one of our "side projects" around the office. 

We had the top of a 1U case from a Foundstone Enterprise Vulnerability Scanner box that was laying around the office and thought, how could we make this a little better? 

Using a skull and cross bones graphic we found online, we printed it out, coated the back with spray adhesive (great idea Jeremiah), then traced it with a dremel! Once the remains of our paper were removed, we touched up the lines freehand and wiped it down with a wet paper towel. It came out awesome and definitely gets a lot of great attention here in the office. 

Created anything awesome around the office recently? Let us know in the comments below!
