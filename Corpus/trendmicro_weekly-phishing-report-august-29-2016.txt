Weekly Phishing Report: August 29, 2016
Week of August 21 – August 27, 2016

For the first time in months, Credit Union was amongst the top 20 brands for this week’s phishing report.
In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >10% decrease in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Almost every industry saw a decrease in phishing activity; Email Providers (>80%), Computer Hardware (>25%), and Banking (>20%) saw the biggest decreases. Phishing activity increased (minimally) in only one industry for the top 20 brands we’re tracking – Internet and Information Services (>2%).
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
