How to Track Your Malware Analysis Findings
The field of incident response, forensics, and malware analysis is full of thrilling hunts and exciting investigations where you have an opportunity to aggressively pursue the activities of adversaries. While technical acumen certainly supports these efforts, a truly successful execution requires both a well-crafted process and detailed documentation of the journey through that process. Meticulous documentation allows you to easily retrace your analysis flow (particularly important if the work supports any litigation), and it facilitates information sharing so others can benefit from your analysis approach and results. More importantly, if a malware analysis effort continues for any substantial period of time, tracking what you've done and what is yet to be done is difficult without comprehensive notes. Generating documentation is clearly one of the less glamorous parts of malware analysis, but it's absolutely necessary to be an effective analyst.
Documentation approaches I've heard of include using a word processing program, a wiki, a mind map, a dirty napkin, and hope (that you'll just remember). Each of these styles has pros and cons - some are too structured, some are not structured enough.  Just like the analysis process itself, the documentation cannot be too rigid and must allow for some creative freedom; otherwise, it will simply go unused. The goal, of course, is not to find a perfect format, but to use one consistently that allows you to track the investigation process and results. My personal rule is if you don't document it, it didn't happen.
Here  is a Word document template I created to record analysis details when performing manual malware analysis of Windows executable files. I've found that a structured Word document provides me the organization I need to quickly note by observations and screenshots without restricting my analysis approach. Not only does the template include the key components of malware analysis, but it also refers to specific tools that can be helpful in gathering certain data. Please note that the document is intended to be a guide, and it should not be used as a comprehensive process document.
The template is divided into several sections:
 You're welcome to use the template and tailor it to your own analysis process and other file types. I'd be grateful for any feedback or revised templates.
Developing a documentation medium you're comfortable with is an iterative process, so if it's unclear what fits your style, try one approach and customize it as necessary. If it's not working, move on and try something new. Developing a habit of reflection (i.e. What worked? What didn't work?) will not only help you create better documentation, but it will also improve your analysis methodology.
