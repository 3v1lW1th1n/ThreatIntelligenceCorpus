Hosting Companies Targeted in Recent Phishing Attacks
Earlier today, Cyveillance detected attacks targeting Web hosting companies and their customers. As part of one of the attacks, the email below is sent to users:

As you can see, the email asks the user to “confirm your FTP details”. The user is instructed to click on the link in the email that routes him or her to the fake administrator’s Website below:

On the fake Website, the user is asked to provide login credentials. If the credentials are entered, then the user would basically hand over access to every Website controlled by that specific login. Users can avoid falling victim to this attack by never clicking on the link within the emails and only accessing online applications directly through known Web sites and pages.
