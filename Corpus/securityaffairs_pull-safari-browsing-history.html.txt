					Apple’s iCloud saved the deleted Safari browsing history over the years					
Safari history is synced across the devices used by a specific iCloud account. When the user deletes a record on one device, it will disappear on all other devices in a few seconds when the devices are connected to the Internet.
Users can set iCloud to store their browsing history, in this way it will be available from all the user’s connected devices. The researchers discovered that even if the user deletes the history, iCloud doesn’t actually erase it but keeps it in a format invisible to the user.
“However, those same records will be kept in Apple iCloud for much longer. In fact, we were able to access records dated more than one year back. The user does not see those records and does not know they still exist on Apple servers.” reads a blog post published by the Elcomsoft’s CEO Vladimir Katalov. 
“In fact, we were able to access records dated more than one year back,” 
The experts used the Elcomsoft Phone Breaker forensic tool to extract files from an iCloud account.
How does it work?
In order to extract Safari history from iCloud it is necessary to be authenticated into the user’s Apple ID. The operation can be carried on using login credentials or by using an authentication token extracted from the user’s computer. The authentication tokens are automatically created by iCloud Control Panel on Windows and Mac computers that were synced with iCloud.
The Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can be used by experts to extract iCloud authentication tokens.
“By using the token to log in, you’ll bypass both the password and the secondary authentication prompt if two-factor authentication is enabled on the user’s account. As a result, iCloud access alert will not be delivered to the user.” states the post.
Below the procedure to extract Safari browsing history from iCloud with Elcomsoft Phone Breaker:

The forensic implication of the discovery is serious because it implies the possibility to conduct surveillance activity as explained in the post.
“Forensic use of synced data is hard to underestimate. Unlike cloud backups that are created daily at best, iCloud sync works nearly in real-time. Being able to track suspect’s activities almost no delay can be invaluable for surveillance and investigations.” states Katalov.
“Since deleting browsing history from iCloud is nearly impossible for the user, discovering illicit activities becomes much easier. Experts will be able to recover visits to extremist and other illicit Web sites even if the suspect deletes their browser history or wipes their iPhone.”
Keeping a copy of a user’s browser history can certainly be “invaluable for surveillance and investigations,” Katalov said. But it’s unclear if Apple knew that its iCloud service was storing the deleted records.
Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but experts from Elcomsoft noticed that after they disclosed the issue, Apple started “purging” older browser history records from iCloud.
“we have informed media about this issue in advance, and they reached Apple for comments. As far as we know, Apple has not responded, but started purging older history records. For what we know, they could be just moving them to other servers, making deleted records inaccessible from the outside; but we never know for sure. Either way, as of right now, for most iCloud accounts we can see history records for the last two weeks only (deleted records for those two weeks are still there though).” states the blog post. But now only deleted records as old as only two weeks can be extracted, the forensic company said.
Elcomsoft suggests disabling the syncing of Safari browsing history from iCloud.
