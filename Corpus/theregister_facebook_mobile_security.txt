Facebook gets mobile privacy
Social networkers stricken by a sudden attack of paranoia can relax - you can now adjust your Facebook privacy settings from the palm of your hand.
Android users get a new client too, with embedded video playback and photograph management, but even Android users have to switch to the browser to adjust their privacy settings remotely.
The security site is at m.facebook.com/privacy, and worked for us when we had a quick look; though Facebook is warning that not everyone will be able to access it immediately as the service is rolled out.
The new Android client links into the notification tray and is a bit more finger-friendly, but it's an incremental improvement rather than anything spectacular. It’s already in the Android Marketplace.
We have to wonder what kind of life-changing event would make one urgently need to adjust one’s Facebook privacy settings, though it’s probably more a matter of being able to do it when you remember - like when someone in the pub, whom you’ve never met, mentions being able to see your profile. ®
