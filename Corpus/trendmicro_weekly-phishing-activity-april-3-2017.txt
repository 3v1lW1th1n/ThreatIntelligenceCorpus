Weekly Phishing Activity: April 3, 2017
Week of March 26 – April 1, 2017

This week, we saw a decrease in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. This is due to the mitigation of a Rock Phish, which skyrocketed activity in the Telecommunications industry last week.
Overall activity decreased >85%, with the largest decreases in Telecommunications (>95%), Hospitality (>45%) and Storage and Systems Management (>70%).
Increases in phishing activity included: Social Networks (>135%), eCommerce (>85%), and Internet and Information Services (>55%).
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
