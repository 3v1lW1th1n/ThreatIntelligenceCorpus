Twitter Security and Privacy Settings You Need to Know
To kick off the new year, we are restarting our tutorial screencast series where we attempt to briefly walk users through the process of locking down their various online accounts. Todayâ€™s video, which is just slightly longer than we had hoped, thoroughly details the steps necessary to ensure that your Twitter account is as private and secure as possible.
We apologize for the left-right confusion at 1:05. The gear icon is very clearly in the top right, not the top left. Also, there are two things we failed to mention.
As always, drop any of your own suggestions in the comments section below.
