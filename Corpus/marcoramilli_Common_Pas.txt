Common Passwords


This morning looking on the floor under my desk I  picked up a yellow post-it. There was written:Password: "qwerty". Suddenly came in my mind a site read some time ago with the top 500 worst passwords. I started a deep google search and I found the password "qwerty" in the top ten !Since people don't care about password's security how can security researcher increase security ? You can add all the security systems that you want, but if the root password is "qwerty" it's pretty much difficult to guarantee the security of the system .
