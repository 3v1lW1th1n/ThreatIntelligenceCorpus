Microsoft Patch Tuesday for May Includes Updates for Actively-Exploited Vulnerabilities
For May 2018, Microsoft’s monthly release of security updates — also known as Patch Tuesday — addressed a number of vulnerabilities, most notably two vulnerabilities that were already actively exploited in attacks.
One of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2018-8174, which is a remote code execution flaw in the way the VBScript engine handles objects in memory. Exploiting this vulnerability results in a system memory corruption that could potentially allow an attacker to gain administrative rights via arbitrary code execution. The attacker can then manipulate the system for malicious purposes. Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) also noted that the vulnerability bears similarities to CVE-2018-1004, which was patched during the last update. There have also been reported attacks exploiting this vulnerability by threat actors.
The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-8120, is an elevation of privilege vulnerability that exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to handle objects in memory properly. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code in kernel mode to install programs, manipulate data, or even create new accounts with full user rights in the user’s system. Although there have been reports that the malware is actively being exploited, there is no information as of yet on the impact of the exploitation.
Other notable vulnerabilities addressed in this round of updates include the Hyper-V Remote Code Execution vulnerability CVE-2018-0959 and the Hyper-V vSMB Remote Code Execution vulnerability  CVE-2018-0961. While the cause of the bugs is different for the two vulnerabilities, both could allow an attacker using a guest operating system (OS) to elevate privileges and execute code via a specially crafted program running on the guest OS.
This month’s Patch Tuesday includes eleven vulnerabilities disclosed via Trend Micro’s ZDI:
Alongside, Adobe also released their own set of security updates, which include:
