Stop bringing your smartphone into the bathroom
Each year the number of people “addicted to Internet” grows rapidly. We can read news, communicate with friends, look through photos and videos right from our smartphones. It’s only logical, that people store important data in their phones, as well as access social media and Internet bank from their mobile devices.
The downside to this is that many of us neglect security of these devices. Kaspersky Lab has conducted a research and found out that more than a half of respondents don’t use remote block or find-my-device features. Only a quarter of respondents tread carefully when they connect to public Wi-Fi. About a third of the surveyed take their phones to bathrooms, and every second goes in bed with a smartphone.

The question that arises here is whether it’s safe to take unsecure connected devices literally everywhere? While taking a relaxing bath and reading a book on your device, you can easily miss the moment when a Trojan turns a camera on and takes several steamy shots.

OK, let’s put aside the fact, that any mobile devices are a boon to spies. There is another common scenario: according to our data, a quarter of users whose device had been lost or stolen discovered that their personal or secret information had been leaked online.
