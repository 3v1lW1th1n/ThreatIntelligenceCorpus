Weekly Phishing Activity: February 13, 2017

This week in phishing activity, we saw a >5% decrease in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. The biggest decreases in activity were seen in Hospitality (>60%), Telecommunications (>45%), and Email Providers (>40%).
Only two industries saw increases in phishing activity last week: Internet and Information Services (>55%) and Banking (>15%).
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
