In the last hours, the hacktivists leaked online names, emails, and passwords of Israeli public employees and shared a list of US government sites to target, calling on action against them.
Anonymous leaked data belonging to only a handful of the sites, this is the retaliation of the collective against the US Government for its politics in the Middle East.
Anonymous operation aims to protect Palestine and protest against Donald Trump’s choice to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
