					A massive cyber attack hit the Algerian state telecom operator Algerie Telecom					
The Algerian state telecom operator Algerie Telecom confirmed on Friday that it was hit by a series of cyber attacks aimed to hack and disrupt its system.
The company was able to repel the attack and security services managed to identify and arrest the attackers.
At the time of writing, there are no further details about the attacks or the motivation of the hackers.
According to a statement issued by the company, its staff was able to protect the operational infrastructure with the help of security services.

The rapid increase in the number of cyber attacks is raising concerns in Algeria especially over the security of recently launched services, such as the recently adopted e-payment system for electricity and water bills.
“Iman Houda Faraoun, Minister of Post, Information and Communication Technologies and Digital Economy, said the e-commerce bill, which had been approved by the Council of Ministers, will come into force as soon as it is approved by the parliament.” reported the Xinhuanet.com website.
“She promised that the e-commerce process will be fully protected, as e-financial transactions data, invoices and postal and bank cards will remain confidential.”
