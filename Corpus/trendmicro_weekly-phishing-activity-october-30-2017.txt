Weekly Phishing Activity: October 30, 2017

This week, we saw a minimal increase in overall phishing activity – just less than 5% – for the top 20 brands we monitor. The industries that saw the largest increases were Computer Software (>160%), Internet & Information Services (>40%), and Storage & Systems Management Software (>30%).
Only three industries saw decreases in phishing activity: Electronic Payment Systems (>40%), eCommerce (>20%), and Banking (>15%).
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
