NIST Appendix J.


Hi Folks,this morning I want to point out the new draft of Appendix J : "Privacy Control Catalog" written by NIST scientist.Appendix J, Privacy Control Catalog, is a new addition to NISTâ€™s family of standards and guidelines that will be incorporated into the 2011 update to Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, projected for release in December 2011. Due to the importance and special nature of the material in this Appendix, it is being publicly vetted separately from the other changes to the publication which will be released later this year. The objectives of the Privacy Appendix are fourfold:Provide a structured set of privacy controls, based on international standards and best practices, that help organizations enforce requirements deriving from federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and guidance;Establish a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations;Demonstrate the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal information systems, programs, and organizations; andPromote closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and guidance.The entire document can be found here.
