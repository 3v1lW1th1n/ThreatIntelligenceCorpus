Critical infrastructure: a role model to protect normal businesses?
After many years of working with clients trying to protect their industrial systems – from oil refineries to railway systems – you learn one thing: critical infrastructure needs special attention. Like normal companies, industrial facilities depend on computers and software, but the range of solutions in use is very different from a typical office. You can find ten-year-old machines still working as though they are as good as new, and operators are not worried about the cost of replacement. Instead, they ask how much it costs to stop those machines for just an hour, because industrial operators face million-dollar losses from downtime on one side and compliance failure fines ranging from $1K to $1M per day on the other.
The importance of reliability and continuity is so high in this environment, that a fraction of the strict SLAs they face will, in fact, boost the operations of a regular business. So, do companies with traditional infrastructure have something to learn from critical operations? The answer is ‘yes’ and ‘no’ at the same time.

When we were developing our specialized security software for industrial facilities, there were some unique requirements we had to meet. Let me name a few here.
 
These are the positive examples of critical infrastructure specifics that may be adopted by traditional businesses right away. But here are a few things that would be better if they stay within the manufacturing and energy sectors.
