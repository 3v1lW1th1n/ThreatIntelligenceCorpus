The flaw was discovered last week by the expert Andris Atteka who filed also a bug report.
“Recently I reported a crash bug in Google Chrome (issue #533361). This issue reminded me of the recent Skype vulnerability – both occur with simple URL strings. So how can you crash Google Chrome? By adding a NULL char in the URL string:

Unfortunately no reward was awarded as this was deemed to be only a DOS vulnerability. Anyway, making secure software is much harder than finding issues in it. Thanks Google.” wrote Andris Atteka.

Experts at The Register published the image of two URLs that could be used to crash Chrome, users can kill their browser just rolling the mouse over them in a page, or launching them from another application such as an email client, or pasting them into the address bar.

The above URLs trigger a breakpoint rather than exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability.
The two URL works on Chrome 45.0.2454.93 on OS X El Capitan and Windows 10 and also Opera 32.0 which is based on Chromium 45 crash. The experts also noticed Chromebooks crashing by managing the URL, meanwhile Android’s Chrome seems to be immune.
The Chromium team is currently working to fix the issue.
