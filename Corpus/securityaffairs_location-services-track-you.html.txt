“You can yourself check your every move from here. You just need to log in with the same account you use on your Smartphone, that’s it. The map will display all the records of everywhere you‘ve been for the last day to month on your screen,” Elizabeth Flux wrote on Junkee.com reports. 
If you have a Google account, than login in and do the same to check your Location History.
