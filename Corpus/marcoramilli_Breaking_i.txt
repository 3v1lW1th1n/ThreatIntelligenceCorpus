Breaking into Your Home


Knowing what are you doing and what have you done it's not enough, now everyone could knows how is you home.This sentence is provocative, I know .., but unfortunately is the main direction that Internet is choosing through new technologies like "Web 2.0" and Semantic Web. I wont say that is bad, I just want point out that these technologies are dangerous for  unwitting people that don't know these issues. Mybe in late 20XY people will figure out the meaning to upgrade pictures on FB or personal news on Twitter and so forth..The house in the picture is the house of a friend of mine ... ... it's not on sale... but you know everything.Actually , it's a great software for people who wants to buy a new home .... Maybe it's not so great for people which have just bought one.
