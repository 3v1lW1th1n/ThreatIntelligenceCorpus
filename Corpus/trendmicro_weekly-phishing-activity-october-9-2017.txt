Weekly Phishing Activity: October 9, 2017

This week, we saw an overall increase of >10% in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we monitor. The industries that saw the largest increases in activity included,  Banking (>50%), Storage & System Management Software (>15%), and Electronic Payment Systems (>10%).
The industries that saw the largest decreases in phishing activity were: eCommerce at >35%, Internet & Information Services at >30%, and Computer Software at >25%.
By pulling information from major Internet Service Providers (ISP), partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honey pots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
