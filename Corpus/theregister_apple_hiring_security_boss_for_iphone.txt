Apple seeks product security boss after iPhone loss
Apple is advertising for a new head of product security, following the second loss of an iPhone prototype.
The new hire, based at Cupertino, will be required to handle “the protection of, and managing risks to, Apple’s unreleased products and related intellectual property,” the job ad reads. Given that not one but two iPhone prototypes have apparently been left in drinking establishments, a strong liver might also be an asset – as would a cozy relationship with California police.
Apple isn’t looking for a traditional thick-necked security guard however. The new hire will need an advanced degree, certification from security authorities or at least five years experience in the industry. They’ll also need to handle risk assessments and recommend new security strategies for the company.
Some have questioned whether Apple has been deliberately leaving prototypes out as a publicity stunt. After all, to lose one prototype in a bar is understandable but two looks slightly fishy. However, this looks unlikely given Apple’s legendary secrecy fetish and its heavy-handed response in both cases.
With the iPhone 4, the police seized the computers of Gizmodo editor Jason Chen, after the prototype fell into his hands. With the latest loss Apple staff may also have impersonated police officers to get enter and search the house of the man accused of having it. Such conduct is illegal in California and carries a recommended prison sentence of a year. ®
