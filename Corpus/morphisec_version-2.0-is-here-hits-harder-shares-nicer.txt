In the first half of 2017 alone, organizations have had to cope with a slew of new tactics: a surge in evasive, fileless attacks, record breaking attack propagation speeds and the rise of 64-bit attacks. The latest version of Morphisec Endpoint Threat Prevention gives security teams the answer to tackle these trends plus unknown threats to come.
Morphisec provides a crucial memory-defense layer to prevent the most dangerous and destructive threats while preserving business efficiency and reducing operational risk. Version 2.0 of Morphisec Endpoint Security brings simpler administration and provides  expanded protection scenarios. Expanded threat intelligence capabilities give security teams instantaneous visibility into threats and business risks and the means to share these findings across departments and stakeholders.
