Manual SQL Injection Exploitation Step by Step

This article is based on our previous article where you have learned different techniques to perform SQL injection manually using dhakkan. Today we are again performing SQL injection manually on a live website “vulnweb.com” in order to reduce your stress of installing setup of dhakkan.
We are going to apply same concept and techniques as performed in Dhakkan on different the platform
Let’s begin!
http://www.hackingarticles.in/beginner-guide-sql-injection-part-1/
Open given below targeted URL in the browser
 So here we are going test SQL injection for “id=1″

Now use error base technique by adding an apostrophe (‘) symbol at the end of input which will try to break the query.
In the given screenshot you can see we have got error message which means the running site is infected by SQL injection.

Now using ORDER BY keyword to sort the records in ascending or descending order for id=1

Similarly repeating for order 2, 3 and so on one by one

From screenshot you can see we have got error at order by 4 which means it consist only three records.

Let’s penetrate more inside using union base injection to select statement from different table.
 From screenshot you can see it is show result for only one table not for others.

Now try to pass wrong input into database through URL by replacing artist=1 from artist=-1 as given below:
 Hence you can see now it is showing the result for remaining two tables also.

Use next query to fetch the name of database
From screen shot you can read the database name acuart

Next query will extract current username as well as version of database system
Here we have retrieve 5.1.73 0ubuntu0 10.04.1 as version and acuart@localhost as current user

Through next query we will try to fetch table name inside the database
From screenshot you  read can name of first table is artists.

From screenshot you can read name of second table is carts.

Similarly repeat the same query for another table with slight change
We got table 3: categ

We got table 4: featured

Similarly repeat same query for table 4, 5, 6, and 7 with making slight changes in LIMIT.
We got table 7: users

Since we didn’t get anything when limit is set 8, 1 hence their might be 8 tables only inside the database.

concat function is use for concatenation of two or more string into single string.
 From screen you can see through concat function we have successfully retrieve all table name inside the
database.

May be we can get some important data from users table, so let’s penetrate more inside.  Again Use concat function for table users for retrieving its entire column names.
Awesome!!  We successfully retrieve all eight column names from inside the table users.
Then I have choose only four column i.e. uname, pass,email and cc for further enumeration.

Use concat function for selecting uname from table users by executing following query through URL
 From screenshot you can read uname: test

Use concat function for selecting pass from table users by executing following query through URL
 From screenshot you can read pass: test

Use concat function for selecting cc (credit card) from table users by executing following query through URL
From screenshot you can read cc: 1234-5678-2300-9000

Use concat function for selecting email from table users by executing following query through URL
http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,group_concat(email),3 from users
From screenshot you can read email: jitendra@panalinks.com
 Enjoy hacking!!
