Pediaphon is a free service by Andreas Bischoff, which generates MP3 audio files from Wikipedia articles by speech synthesis. The service was developed at the University of Hagen, Germany. These files can be played immediately in the web browser or be downloaded for later use in a MP3-Player. A podcast will be generated for each inquiry.

stats.grok.se will add a link to a site showing traffic information for any given page on Wikipedia. By default the link is included in a pre-formatted sentence and links to statistics for the previous month. The default behavior can be manipulated using a small set of parameters.

Deletionpedia
Deletionpedia is a web site containing articles deleted from the English Wikipedia between February and September 2008. Its version of each article includes a header with more information about the deletion such as whether a speedy deletion occurred, where the deletion discussion about the article can be found and which editor deleted the article.
