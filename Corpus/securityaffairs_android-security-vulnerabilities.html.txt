					Google fixes 40 Critical and High Severity flaws in Android					
Patches for 40 vulnerabilities have been included in Google’s May 2016 security update for the Android operating system. Many high and medium severity vulnerabilities, in addition to one low severity vulnerability, are patched in this latest update.
The critical issues resolved are: “remote code execution flaws in mediaserver, privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the Android debugger, the Qualcomm TrustZone component, the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver, the kernel, and the NVIDIA video driver.” The mediaserver flaws permit attackers to remotely execute code within the context of the mediaserver service, while the privilege escalation vulnerabilities would allow for a local malicious application to execute random code in the context of the Android debugger or the kernel.

The high severity issues addressed with this month’s update involve an information disclosure vulnerability in the Qualcomm tethering controller and a remote denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the Qualcomm hardware code, remote code execution vulnerabilities in the kernel and Bluetooth, privilege elevation flaws in various Qualcomm components, Wi-Fi, mediaserver, the MediaTek Wi-Fi driver and Binder.
The moderate severity issues resolved by the update focus on privilege escalation and information disclosure vulnerabilities.
The Android May 2016 update provides patches for vulnerabilities reported between October 15, 2015, and March 23. Security Week reports:
“The critical vulnerabilities have been assigned the following CVE identifiers: CVE-2016-2428, CVE-2016-2429, CVE-2016-2430, CVE-2016-2431, CVE-2016-2432 CVE-2015-0569, CVE-2015-0570, CVE-2016-2434, CVE-2016-2435, CVE-2016-2436, CVE-2016-2437 and CVE-2015-1805.
The CVE identifiers assigned to these flaws are CVE-2016-2438, CVE-2016-2060, CVE-2016-2439, CVE-2016-2440, CVE-2016-2441, CVE-2016-2442, CVE-2016-2443, CVE-2015-0571, CVE-2016-2444, CVE-2016-2445, CVE-2016-2446, CVE-2016-2447, CVE-2016-2448, CVE-2016-2449, CVE-2016-2450, CVE-2016-2451, CVE-2016-2452, CVE-2016-2453 and CVE-2016-2454.”
For Nexus devices, a security update, which includes patches for most of these flaws, has been sent out to these devices. Google’s partners have been alerted and the source code patches will be posted on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository within the next couple of days.
Google reports having revised its severity ratings in an effort to better align them with real world impact to users.
