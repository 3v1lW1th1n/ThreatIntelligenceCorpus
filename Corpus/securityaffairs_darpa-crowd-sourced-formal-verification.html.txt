The US Department of Defense Is evaluating the use of video games for finding software vulnerabilities with the collaboration of a network of volunteers. The idea is revolutionary, the support offered to DoD analyst could be theoretically unlimited according John Murray, a program director in SRI International’s computer science laboratory.
Today only adults are allowed to participate in the program due strictly government regulations regarding volunteer participants.
John Murray and his team worked in the creation one game specialized in the above task, the application called Xylem is the demonstration that is possible to exploit game players’ actions to find software vulnerabilities.
The CircuitBot game involves users to link up a team of robots to carry out a mission, man while Flow Jam requires the user to analyze and adjust a cable network to maximize its throughput.

The principle is to correlate complex math problems onto puzzle games that would be fun to play.
To achieve the goals of Crowd Sourced Formal Verification, DARPA designed the Verigames.com portal involving the elite designers, mathematicians, and developers  and Topcoder’s community of over 500,000 registered global members.
According Murray some types of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows or flaws that result in privilege escalation, fit particularly well into the puzzle format.
“We are able to take those small snippets of code that need further analysis and turn them into the parameters to generate a puzzle,” he said.
