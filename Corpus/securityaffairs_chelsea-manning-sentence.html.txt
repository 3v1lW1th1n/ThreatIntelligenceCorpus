Recently Wikileaks announced the Assange’s intention agree to US extradition if Obama grants Manning’s clemency.


“Obama may well have just saved Chelsea Manning’s life,” commented Sarah Harrison, who has defended Manning as Active Director of the Courage nonprofit. “Freeing her is clearly and unambiguously the right thing to do.”
