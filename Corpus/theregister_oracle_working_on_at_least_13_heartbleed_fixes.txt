Oracle working on at least 13 Heartbleed fixes
Oracle has emitted its formal advice about Heartbleed, revealing it has 13 products that need a patch and 14 more “which may be vulnerable”.
Detailed here, Oracle points out that all its cloud services should be Heartbleed-proof, and that six of its products – including Oracle Linux 6 and Solaris 11.2 – were vulnerable but can be patched with existing updates.
The news is not so good for the following products, as Oracle puts them in a bucket containing software that is “... likely vulnerable …. but for which no fixes are yet available.”
Big Red also has another list of “products still under investigation, which may be vulnerable”. That list includes Oracle-branded fiber channel switches from Cisco and Qlogic, and the Sun Storage Common Array Manager.
Oracle has not, however, committed to a timetable to deliver patches. The post we've linked to says “Global Product Security will continue to follow up with the various product development teams within Oracle to monitor the creation of the appropriate fixes, determine whether additional products may be affected, and whether updated mitigation instructions are required.”
The post also says “ … future Patchsets and Critical Patch Updates for affected Oracle products may include the necessary patches to remove this vulnerability.”
That's a rather different approach to VMware's decision to get all the patches it needs to make done this week. Which do you prefer? ®
