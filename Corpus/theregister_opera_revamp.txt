Opera update plugs heap big buffer overflow bug
Opera has fixed three potentially nasty security vulnerabilities with the release of a major new version of its web browser software.
A heap buffer overflow bug involving the string to number conversion technology in previous versions of Opera created a means to inject hostile code onto vulnerable systems. Opera version 10.10 plugs this hole, along with an problem with error messages that posed an information leakage risk. The update also addresses a "moderate" security issue discovered by Google, details on which are being withheld. More on these bugs in a security advisory from Secunia here.
The release of Opera version 10.10 on Monday marked the debut of Opera Unite, a web server technology that now comes baked into Opera's browser software. The technology allows users to stream music or share files, such as photos, directly from their browser.
The update also addresses a large number of minor stability and performance glitches, as explained in Opera's release notes here. ®
