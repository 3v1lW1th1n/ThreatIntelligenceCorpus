How to Slash Incident Response Stress With Threat Intelligence
By The Recorded Future Team on May 30, 2018
Incident response is, by definition, a reactive discipline.
After all, you can’t respond to an incident that hasn’t happened yet.
But this reactivity can (and often does) go much too far. An incident response team that becomes completely reactive can easily become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of incoming security alerts.
When this happens, the team is no longer able to respond promptly to serious threats, and a great deal of cyber risk goes unmanaged.
Thankfully, there’s a better way.
Think about the typical incident response lifecycle. For most organizations, it looks something like this:
Do you see the problem here?
This process is practically designed to be completely reactive. As soon as the volume of incoming alerts or incidents reaches a certain level, stress is guaranteed.
To ensure your incident response team doesn’t become overwhelmed, two functions are necessary:
To effectively prepare for and prioritize security incidents, incident response teams need to answer a series of questions. For starters:
To answer all of these questions, one key ingredient is required: intelligence.
Threat intelligence helps incident response teams develop a detailed understanding of the threat landscape, and how their organization fits into it. In combination with internal data, this helps them map out the most common or likely threats to arise, along with their potential impact. In turn, this facilitates the development of strong response infrastructure and repeatable processes.
At the same time, powerful threat intelligence provides insights in real time, enabling incident response teams to make informed decisions on how to respond to the latest cyber threats and trends.
Put simply, threat intelligence helps incident response teams be more proactive in their response — handling incidents faster, more effectively, and in order of the risk they pose.
For any discipline that requires personnel to make regular decisions, it’s important to keep in mind the factors that can help or hinder the decision-making process. All three of the following factors can have a profound effect on the quality and timeliness of any decision:
For incident response, it’s easy to imagine how the existence or lack of these factors will play out. When analysts are swamped with huge quantities of data, and forced to separate the relevant from the useless on their own (as they often are), decisions will inevitably be slow, and sometimes inaccurate.
But that isn’t the analysts’ fault.
If those same analysts were provided with more accurate, relevant, and concise intelligence, they would consistently make faster, better decisions.
And this phenomenon isn’t unique to incident response. Give those same advantages to your security operations personnel, vulnerability management team, or even your security leaders, and they will in turn make faster, more informed decisions with less decision fatigue.
