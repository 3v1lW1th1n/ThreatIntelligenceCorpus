It’s 2018: Time to assess your cyberrisk
What springs to mind when you hear the phrase: “The future’s already here”? It evokes thoughts of new technologies that are poised to make life easier, better, and safer — not modern cyberthreats. But so-called next-generation threats are already here, too. On February 20, within the framework of the European Summit on Information Security (TEISS 2018), we will describe in detail what next-gen threats are and how to handle them.
Our experts believe that 2018 will see cybercriminals adopt ever more original and unusual methods. Instead of head-on attacks, they will navigate their way through the information systems of subcontractors and partners, conduct cyberespionage through mobile devices, focus their attacks on UEFI and BIOS, and hack routers and modems.
A cyberincident can affect almost any company, so you need to know not only how to avoid incidents, but also how best to respond to them. After all, the potential losses depend directly on the response time and performance of the detection technologies deployed. We carried out a study of IT security risks and found that, for large businesses, the average recovery cost of an incident — if promptly detected — is $456,000. If detection takes more than a week, however, this cost more than doubles, to $1.2 million. Ergo, the faster you identify and respond to an incident, the less costly it will be.
