HP slurps up security software firm
HP has bought Fortify Software, strengthening its application security software portfolio.
The software security assurance firm essentially offers products which check the security of your software, help organise vulnerabilities so the most dangerous are fixed first and help manage the process of fixing them.
Fortify offers various compliance, vulnerability and detection products. It also offers hosted security testing.
The company was founded in late 2002 by Roger Thornton with money from VCs Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Before this Thornton was an adviser to ETrade and eBay. The Silicon Valley native has also worked for Apple, Centerline Software and Sun Microsystems.
Fortify's customers include Experian, WaMu, JP Morgan, Gap and the US Air Force. Financial terms were not provided.
Fortify will continue to operate as a standalone business for now, but will be gradually borged into HP's Software and Solutions division.
The agreement follows a years after IBM acquired Ounce Labs, a less established competitor to Fortify that also plays in the application security and assurance market. ®
