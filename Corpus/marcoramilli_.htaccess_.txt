.htaccess automation


Hi Folks,today I needed to write up a .htaccess for a web site of mines. It has been a while since I didn't write it, and as always happens I forget its syntax ... well I forget almost everything about it. I thought... No way, I don't wanna study again the syntax , it must be an automatic and online tool for its generation. Of course there is ! :D And here it is !.htaccess redirect.htaccess is a very useful web server' s feature. Unfortunately people like me who don't use this feature very often, since not web-designer, tend to forget how to write it. Using this free and online tool we can seep-up our "web-developer's hour". Enjoy your future htaccess creation ! Now you can forget about it ;)
