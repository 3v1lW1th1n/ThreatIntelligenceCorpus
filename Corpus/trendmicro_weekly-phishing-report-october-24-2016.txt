Weekly Phishing Report: October 24, 2016
Week of October 16 – October 22, 2016
Within the top 20 phishing targets, Dating Site was the industry that saw the least amount of phishing activity.
In this week’s phishing report, we saw a minimal decrease (< 5%) in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Email Providers (>45%), Banking (>20%), and Internet and Information Services (>10%) all saw increases. Electronic Payment Systems saw a >35% decrease.
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
