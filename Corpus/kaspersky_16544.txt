WannaCry: What you need to know
The unprecedented outbreak of Trojan ransomware WannaCry has created a worldwide plague affecting home users and businesses. We have already posted some basics about WannaCry, and in this post we will provide further advice particularly for businesses. It is urgent and critical to know what WannaCry is, how it spreads, what dangers it poses, and how to stop it.
One of the key reasons the Trojan erupted so quickly is that it transmits itself using an exploit, entering through a known Windows vulnerability with no user intervention (mistakes) needed. And once one computer is infected, the malware attempts to spread itself to all other systems in the local network.
Therefore, the very first action to take is to repair the vulnerability. System administrators need to take the following steps:
Current users are already protected from ransomware, including WannaCry. However, we recommend that you take a few extra preventive measures.
Embedded systems are particularly vulnerable to WannaCry, mainly because they tend to be less well protected. And although ATMs and POS systems are usually protected using specialized solutions, the protection of such systems as information terminals is overlooked. However, bringing such systems back on track may cost a fortune, especially if your company operates hundreds of them.

We highly recommend using solutions that employ Default Deny mode. Kaspersky Embedded Systems Security was developed specifically for embedded systems, and it is an effective and resource-efficient protection solution.
To help businesses understand and defend against the WannaCry ransomware, our experts held an emergency webinar. Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, senior security researcher in our Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT), and Matt Suiche from Comae Technologies presented the very latest information on how the ransomware breaches defenses and also on the subsequent stages of the attack.
