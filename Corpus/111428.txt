A Google spokesperson on Wednesday claimed that the way Android connects to most websites, including Google sites and others without export certificates are not subject to the FREAK flaw that’s dominated headlines this week. The flaw enables attackers to downgrade their victims’ SSL clients RSA key and compromise their connections with a man-in-the-middle attack.
“We encourage all websites to disable support for export certificates, Google said before adding that its “developed a patch to protect Android’s connection to sites that do expose export certs and that patch has been provided to partners.”
