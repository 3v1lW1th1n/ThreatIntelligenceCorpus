					A Kernel Exploit for Sony PS4 Firmware 4.05 is available online					
Good news for PlayStation gamers, the developer SpecterDev finally released a fully-functional kernel exploit for PlayStation 4 (firmware 4.05) dubbed ‘namedobj’.
PS4 gamers who are running firmware version lower than 4.05 need to update their gaming console to trigger the exploit.
The Kernel exploit was released two months after Team Fail0verflow revealed the technical details about the first PS4 Kernel Exploit.
The kernel exploit ‘namedobj’ is now available on Github, it works for the PlayStation 4 on 4.05FW and allows users to run arbitrary code on the device.
“In this project you will find a full implementation of the “namedobj” kernel exploit for the PlayStation 4 on 4.05. It will allow you to run arbitrary code as kernel, to allow jailbreaking and kernel-level modifications to the system. This release however, does not contain any code related to defeating anti-piracy mechanisms or running homebrew. This exploit does include a loader that listens for payloads on port 9020 and will execute them upon receival.” reads the description published on GitHub.

The availability of the kernel exploit could allow developers to write a working jailbreak and kernel-level modifications to the system.
Jailbreaking allows removing hardware restrictions implemented by the operating system, it allows users to run custom code on the console and install mods, games, and third-party applications bypassing the anti-piracy mechanisms implemented by Sony.
“This release, however, does not contain any code related to defeating anti-piracy mechanisms or running homebrew,” SpecterDev said.
“This exploit does include a loader that listens for payloads on port 9020 and will execute them upon receival.”
Reading the “Notes” we can notice that the developer warns that the exploit should not work for some users.
“This exploit is actually incredibly stable at around 95% in my tests. WebKit very rarely crashes and the same is true with kernel. I’ve built in a patch so the kernel exploit will only run once on the system. You can still make additional patches via payloads,” SpecterDev warned.
At this point, experts at Sony will work to identify the flaws triggered by the kernel exploit and fix them.
Stay Tuned.
