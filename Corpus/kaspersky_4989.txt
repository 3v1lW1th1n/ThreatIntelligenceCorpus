Kaspersky Lab vs world poverty: a case study
Kaspersky Lab is pleased to share its successful experience of collaborating with the largest NGO in the world, Bangladesh-based BRAC. It is an international development organization present in all 64 districts of Bangladesh, and in other countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Founded in 1972 as a small relief organization in Bangladesh, it now employs nearly 120,000 people in 10 countries in Asia and Africa, helping an estimated 138 million people escape from poverty.
Among its extensive work in economic and social development, education, healthcare and legal aid, microfinance is one of BRAC’s cornerstone programs. Thanks to it, the poor can gain access to loans and savings products, otherwise inaccessible to them, to meet their unique needs.
