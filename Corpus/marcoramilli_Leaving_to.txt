Leaving to Lausanne, SW


Hey guys, I am already in late.. I have my train in half an hour ! I am going to leave Italy to Lausanne, eGov and ePart conference. I am going to talk about "Penetration testing methodologies and how to apply them to Electronic Voting Systems". My talk will be available on the proceedings and on my blog late this evening or tomorrow.I hate to travel by train :(, but this time seemed to be mandatory since Lausanne it's very close to my place.
