Weekly Phishing Report: October 10, 2016
Week of October 2 – October 8, 2016

In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >15% increase in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. We saw the biggest changes in Email Providers (>35%), Internet and Information Services (30%), and Internet Search and Navigation Services (>20%). eCommerce (>25%) and Electronic Payment Systems (>20%) saw the largest decreases in phishing activity.
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM).
