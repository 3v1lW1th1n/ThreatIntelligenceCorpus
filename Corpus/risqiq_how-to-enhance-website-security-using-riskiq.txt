How To Enhance Website Security Using RiskIQ
Website security has become a labor-intensive and technically challenging aspect of information security. Findings from the Verizon Breach Report showed that 70% of strategic web-based attacks in 2014 weren’t targeting website owners; they were after the visitors.
Websites have evolved into an amalgamation of third-party widgets, beacons, client-facing code libraries and digital ads. It’s a pick-your-poison for security professionals of which areas you really want to focus on protecting.
If you’re in vulnerability management, discovering potentially unknown entry points along the web-serving infrastructure through detection and monitoring is critically important. If you’re in incident response, having an external threat detection dashboard would allow you to efficiently drill into alerts and mitigate live threats.
Other security solutions fail to account for the unique nature of websites. When a website renders in a user’s browser, the code is customized based on demographic information including the user’s geolocation, social interactions, plugins and any tracking or analytics engines that have been embedded.
Since each visitor sees a customized form of a website, it’s impossible to detect threats from endpoint sensors or hardware devices. The only way to ensure websites are safe is to ‘see what the user sees’ so that any unwanted activity can be identified and assessed.
RiskIQ detects malware and other web-based threats using our proprietary crawling infrastructure. By varying browsers, click pattern and time on page, our virtual users behave exactly as a human online user would, enabling our technology to continuously monitor while evading anti-detection systems. The virtual users are launched from a global proxy network that covers more than 520 egress points in 40+ countries and is constantly evolving.
Even seemingly innocuous events like minor defacements can be indicative of larger threats. It behooves your remediation efforts to determine who may be interested in defacing your website and why. This is to ensure that something very visible like a defacement isn’t just a veiled attempt to distract your team or test your incident response capabilities.
RiskIQ has been collecting a database of malware, malvertising and correlated malicious infrastructure since 2009. It’s another source with which to overlay threat intelligence to pull contextual awareness at the moment of an incident.
Security professionals from leading banks, health insurance providers, publishers and high tech companies all use RiskIQ to protect their brand, business, employees and customers. If you are a CISO, an incident responder or vulnerability management professional who wants visibility into website threats, contact us for a demo.
