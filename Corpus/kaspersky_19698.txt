Malware spread through PornHub
If you read the title of this article, you know we’re going to discuss an issue that may make some readers blush … yes, malware.
Earlier today, a colleague passed along an article noting that popular online pornography site PornHub was serving ads with baked-in malware that infected users’ computers by pretending to be important browser updates. The attack, reported by Proofpoint, was the work of the KovCoreG group.
You might reflexively say, This can’t harm me! or Who watches porn on the Internet? but PornHub is a very popular site, and that makes the threat relevant to more people than you might expect. According to Alexa, the site is currently ranked the twentieth most popular site in the US, and thirty-seventh in the world. Last year, a reported 92 billion videos (link is safe for work) were watched on its site.
So yeah, this could potentially be pretty big.
