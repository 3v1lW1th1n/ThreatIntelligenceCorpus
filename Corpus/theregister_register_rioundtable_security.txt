In charge of security? We need to talk...
CIO Manifesto If you head up security for your organisation, you probably feel like you’re caught between know-it all techies, ignorant directors and unbending compliance regulations.
So do most of your peers, and that’s why we want to bring you together to discuss the reality of running IT securely in 2015 at our May 20 roundtable.


The world in 2015: Even fewer PCs, even more security woes


You might feel that there are less threats, but that the serious ones are way more scary than a few years ago. You might feel the woes are less about external attackers after your customer’s credit card details, and more about users with multiple devices and memories like sieves.
Either way, you’ve been through the mill and want to share your experiences with your peers - and with us.
The Register Roundtable gives you a chance to swap war stories and learn from each other, and give us some insight into the real world problems today’s top IT bosses face.
We’ll be meeting at a central London Hotel on May 20 at 3pm. The formal discussion will last 90 minutes, and then we’d like you to join us to continue the conversation informally over fine wine and cocktails. The whole event will be conducted under the Chatham House Rule.
We’ll be keeping the numbers down to no more than 12, but please register your interest below and we'll be in touch to let you know if you've secured a place. If you don’t make the list for this event, don’t worry, we’ll make sure you’re on the list for future events.
