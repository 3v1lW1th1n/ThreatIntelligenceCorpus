getprivs
using this command you will confirm the fact that you have not entered the administrator yet. So now, there is no need to worry.

Now use the following exploit
This module will bypass Windows UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when the Windows Event Viewer is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has been invoked. The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess () after starting your payload in a separate process.

As the command will make our file execute we will have a session with administrator privileges as shown
