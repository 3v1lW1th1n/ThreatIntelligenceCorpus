Russian sports doping whistleblower fears for safety after hack
Former Russian runner turned whistleblower in-hiding Yuliya Stepanova has had her World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) account hacked, possibly revealing her physical location to attackers.
Stepanova revealed how Russian sporting agencies had helped athletes dope ahead of sporting events leading to sweeping bans against athletes in that country participating in the Rio Olympic and Paralympic games.
The Anti-Doping Administration and Management System is used by the global drug testing agency and athletes who report their physical location to simplify the drug testing process.
Unknown attackers gained access to Stepanova's username and password, accessing her account in a breach confirmed by WADA.
"Through regular security monitoring of ADAMS, the agency noted that someone, other than Ms Stepanova, had accessed her account," the agency said in a statement.
The organisation says no other athletes have been affected.
Stepanov's husband Vitaly, also in hiding, in 2014 revealed to a German TV station secret footage showing extensive doping in Russian sports, and informed on the Russian Anti-Doping Agency where he worked to WADA.
The duo are living in an undisclosed location in the United States after a brief spell in Berlin. ®
