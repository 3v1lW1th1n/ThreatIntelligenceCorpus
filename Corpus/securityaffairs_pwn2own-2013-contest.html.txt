During the last HP’s Pwn2Own 2013 contest at Information Security Conference PacSec 2013 in Tokyo, two teams of Chinese and Japanese hackers demonstrated the exploitation of zero-day vulnerability in Apple’s Safari browser for the iPhone 5 running iOS 6 and iOS 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S4.
The Pwn2Own contest is organized is to attract hackers into legitimate circles trying to keep them out of the black market.
During the Pwn2Own 2013 contest the Japanese Team MBSD, of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. won $40,000 reward for zero day exploit demonstrating also several exploits against default applications on the Samsung Galaxy S4.

The zero-day allows the attacker to compromise the mobile device in several ways, for example using a drive-by download to install malware on the Smartphone.
