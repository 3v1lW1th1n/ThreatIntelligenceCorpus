Today is not the day to search for a beautician in Russia
Cyphort Labs researcher Nick Bilogorskiy says ransomware authors have infected some 60 Russian websites that collectively attract more than 20 million visitors a month.
The malware man says the attacks are hosted on Russian hosting site Rustelekom.
Visitors to the sites could have the CTB Locker ransomware dropped through the popular and capable Nuclear exploit kit.
Bilogorskiy says affected sites appear to be small businesses, many which have not responded to his warnings that their sites are compromised.
The sites have been compromised over the course of a year, creating what may be a large victim base.
Fitness websites, gamer forums, beautician businesses, and tech news sites have been affected. Some of the infected sites are very popular and/or boast busy forums.
Concerned Windows users can run BitDefender's Anti-Ransomware tool to prevent against CTB Locker and CryptoWall infection. ®
