					The Shipping Giant Clarkson has suffered a security breach					
Clarkson confirmed the  hackers may release some of the stolen data, it hasn’t provided further details due to the ongoing law enforcement investigation.
The information disclosed by the company suggests cyber criminals blackmailed the company requesting the payment of a ransom in order to avoid having its data leaked online.
According to Clarkson, the hackers compromised a single user account to access the systems of the shipping giant.
“Clarkson PLC confirms that it was subject to a cybersecurity incident which involved unauthorised access to the Company’s computer systems.” Clarkson said in a statement. 
“Our initial investigations have shown the unauthorised access was gained via a single and isolated user account which has now been disabled.”
The company has disabled the account after the incident and has started notifying affected customers and individuals.
The company had been expecting the cyber criminals to publish part of the stolen data on Tuesday, but nothing is still happening.

The company said it has been conducting a review of the security of its architecture and announced new IT security measures.
“As you would rightly expect, we’re working closely with specialist police teams and data security experts to do all we can to best understand the incident and what we can do to protect our clients now and in the future,” said Andi Case, CEO of Clarkson. “We hope that, in time, we can share the lessons learned with our clients to help stop them from becoming victims themselves. In the meantime, I hope our clients understand that we would not be held to ransom by criminals, and I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have understandably raised.”
