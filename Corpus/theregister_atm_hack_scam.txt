FBI releases pics of low-level suspects in $9m ATM scam
The FBI has released pictures of two suspects linked to a multi-million dollar ATM heist.
The man and a woman are thought to be street-level accomplices in a global cash machine heist the netted $9m from 130 ATM machines in 49 cities around the globe in a co-ordinated attack that lasted just hours. Investigators reckon the gang used data stolen from RBS WorldPay to create counterfeit payroll cards. These bogus cards were subsequently used to withdraw money from machines across the US as well as Montreal, Moscow, and Hong Kong on the night of 8 November 2008.
Around 100 payroll debit cards — which some firms use to pay wages - were used in the heist but cybercriminals were able to exploit weaknesses in the system to withdraw many times the nominal limit on each card, Fox News reports.
RBS WorldPay admitted in late December that the records of 1.5 million people had been exposed in a hacking attack investigators are linked to the ATM raids.
The FBI pictures show images of a man and a woman withdrawing money from a bank branch in Matteson and a Walgreens in Calumet City, Illinois, the Chicago Tribune reports. ®
