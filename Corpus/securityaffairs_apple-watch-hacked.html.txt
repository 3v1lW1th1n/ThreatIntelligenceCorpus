The Internet of things is probably the paradigm that most of all is invading our daily life, smart objects surround us and collect a huge quantity information enlarging our surface of attack. The problem is exacerbated for wearable devices and the level of security they implement.
Last victim in order of time it the popular Apple Watch, a developer, in fact, has demonstrated how to hack it and run a full web browser on the device. The developer Comex, author of the JailBreakMe, has published a video PoC in which he shows an Apple Watch running a web browser.

The hack showed in the video is important because it demonstrates that it is possible to get the Watch to run arbitrary code, it is not difficult to image that the Comex is working on a ‘jailbreak’ of the Apple Watch, despite the expert hasn’t anticipated anything on his research.
Comex also posted online an image showing, the Watch presenting the iOS dictionary view. Apple has announced that is it already working on a native SDK to open its device to the development community, the SDK will allow coders to develop their apps that run on the Apple Watch rather than through an iPhone app extension like WatchKit.

 
Apple confirmed that native third-party Watch apps are coming “later this year”.
Stay Tuned ….
