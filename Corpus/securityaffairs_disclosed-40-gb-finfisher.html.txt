“And that’s the end of the story until a couple days ago when I hacked in and made off with 40GB of data from Gamma’s networks. I have hard proof they knew they were selling (and still are) to people using their software to attack Bahraini activists, along with a whole lot of other stuff in that 40GB Here’s a torrent of all the data. Please download and seed. Here’s a twitter feed where I’m posting some of the interesting stuff I find in there, starting off slow to build up rather than just publish all the worst shit at once.
I assumed the hacking would be the hard part and once I got the data it would just kinda go viral on it’s own or something. But it turn’s out without any media access or idea how that shit works, getting people to notice or care is actually kind of hard. Please share and seed the torrent!” is reported on the reddit post Gamma International Leaked.

Support costs ranged from 2218 Euros for USB malware support to 331,840 for fifth year support for FinSpy.” reports the Register.
