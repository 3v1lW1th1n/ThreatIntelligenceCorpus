Zombie Photos On Social Networks


Hi Folks,today I wanna point out this interesting experiment made by  University of Cambridge (UK).(quoted)For our experiment, we uploaded a test image onto 16 chosen sites {they're writing about social networks} with default permissions, then noted the URL of the uploaded image. Every site served the test image given knowledge of its URL except for Windows Lives Spaces, whose photo servers required session cookies (a refreshing congratulations to Microsoft for beating the competition in security). [..] here the results [..]A live experiment monitor is here.In my opinion this is a great experiment really useful for monitoring each contributor's privacy. Great work man.
