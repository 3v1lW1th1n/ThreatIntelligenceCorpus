Week of November 1 – 7, 2015
Author: Robert McDaniel

In this week’s phishing activity report, we saw a decrease (>10%) in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Transportation (>25%) saw the greatest increases in phishing activity last week.  While drops in Financial Services (>40%), Internet Content Providers (>30%), and Storage & Systems Management Software (>30%)  phishing attempts counteracted the increases in the aforementioned industry.

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
