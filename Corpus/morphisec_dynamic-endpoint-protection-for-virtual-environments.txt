Register for our webinar Dynamic Endpoint Protection for Virtual Environments on March 21, 2018.
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) offers many advantages but it is not attack proof and highly advanced cyberattacks present an ever growing threat. IT and Security teams need to rethink the fabric, the costs and the risks inherent within virtual environments. Endpoint protection for VDIs has always been problematic as they are extremely sensitive to the performance impact of security products. The wrong security tools will consume resources, slow system boot up and impede productivity.
Join Morphisec and Citrix for an essential webinar that look at the challenges of securing virtual, physical and hybrid environments and how Morphisec’s Moving Target Defense technology is uniquely suited to protect them from advanced threats. Morphisec is verified as Citrix Ready for XenApp and XenDesktop.
