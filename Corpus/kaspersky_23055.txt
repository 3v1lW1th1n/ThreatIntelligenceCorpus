Recently leaked malware source code isn’t Carbanak
Previous statements claimed that it was Carbanak source code that was leaked recently. Kaspersky Lab analysis, however, reveals that the code belongs to another piece of financial malware called Karamanak/Pegasus/Ratopak (not to be confused with Pegasus for iOS spyware). Timestamps suggest that this source code was produced in 2015–2016. The language of the virus writers was definitely native Russian, and they were targeting financial institutions in Russia.
Any financial malware attack, and particularly any attack against well-protected organizations, is a sophisticated operation that requires a lot of preparation and incorporates two key steps: infection and money withdrawal. Although a source code leak could help criminals with the first step, the second stage requires a lot of planning and effort. Therefore, it is unlikely that we will immediately hear about new cyberincidents based on this leak very soon.
