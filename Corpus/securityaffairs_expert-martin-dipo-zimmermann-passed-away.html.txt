This is a sad day for me, my friend and colleague Martin Dipo Zimmermann is passed away after suffering an heart-attack.
Martin was the Chief Technical Officer and co-founder of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Network, I was working with him and other colleagues to threat intelligence activities.
Martin was the Chief Technical Officer and co-founder of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Network, I was working with him and other colleagues to threat intelligence activities.
Martin was a Member of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) European Threat Landscape Stakeholder Group, a Google Security Hall of Fame group member [x0xa] and he was a IBM-Security recognized thought leader in the Info-Sec community.
Martin is a Master, I always had a confrontation professionally challenging with him. We spent a lot of time together on several projects, he supported me on several research on the Deep Web topic, and a few days ago he told me that was preparing interesting material for my new book.
I cannot believe that he was far from us, but this is the life and I desire to remember the smiling Marting that was joking with me last year.
“Martin regularly advocated active defense frameworks and technologies available through open source channels.” said the friend Reza from CyberWarZone.
His skills were:
Threat Intelligence, Threat Actor Monitoring, Trends Analysis, Penetration Testing, Network Architecture, Dark net Research, Information Security Management & Consulting, Incident Response.
A piece of Martin will be always with us … that piece will allow me to be stronger that ever.
Fly high!
