ePart 2010: Switzerland I am coming !


Hi Folks,ePart 2010 accepted the paper that Marco Prandini and I wrote on Applied Penetration Testing  Methodologies, titled: An integrated application of security testing methodologies to e-voting systems . The paper will be published on Springer LNCS proceedings.From 29 August to September 2 we will be in Lausanne (Switzerland). I know that some of my readers are from Switzerland (in particular from Zurich, not so far from Lausanne), so if you like to have a meeting all together in Lausanne or nearby, please contact me, we'll organize a "security"  dinner/lunch.
