PCI Council wants upgradeable credit card readers ... next year
The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI Council) has floated a new standard it hopes will reduce credit card fraud that starts at the point of sale, in part by allowing easier upgrades.
The new version 5.0 of the PCI PIN Transaction Security (PTS) Point-of-Interaction (POI) Modular Security Requirements emerged late last week. The most notable new bits of the proposed standard (PDF) are:
The changes have been made in response to the prevalence of card skimming attacks and as recognition that retailers need the ability to respond quickly as threats emerge. Hard-to-upgrade card-reading kit retards security efforts as retailers resist expensive upgrades when they address obscure attacks. Making card readers upgradeable should mean better point of sale security. That the the United States is now adopting the chip-and-pin (EMV) wireless payment technology so prevalent elsewhere is also cited as a reason for the new round of changes.
But even pre-EMV technologies need better wireless security: Samsung's Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technology lets phones talk to magnetic stripe readers. Even those small exchanges of electromagnetic energy are potentially sniffable, with keys a bigger prize than individual cards.
The new standard comes into force in September 2017, when the current version 4.1 will fade away. ®
