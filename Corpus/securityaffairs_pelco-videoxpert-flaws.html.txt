					Schneider Electric Patches Flaws in Pelco VideoXpert Enterprise product					
The Pelco VideoXpert solution is widely used in commercial facilities worldwide.
The security researcher Gjoko Krstic has found two directory traversal bugs and an improper access control flaw that can be exploited by an attacker to trigger an arbitrary code execution.
Both Schneider Electric and ICS-CERT published security advisories about the CVE-2017-9966, which could be exploited by an attacker to replace certain files and execute malicious code with system privileges.
“By replacing certain files, an authorized user can obtain system privileges and the inserted code would execute at an elevated privilege level.
CVE-2017-9966 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated;” reads the ICS-CERT.
“Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an authorized user to gain system privileges or an unauthorized user to view files.”

Both directory traversal vulnerabilities (tracked as CVE-2017-9964 and CVE-2017-9965) have been classified as medium severity. The first flaw could be exploited by an attacker to bypass authentication or hijack sessions by “sniffing communications.”
The second directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthorized user to access web server files that could contain sensitive information.
These Pelco VideoXpert Enterprise vulnerabilities have been patched with the release of firmware version 2.1. All prior versions are affected.
