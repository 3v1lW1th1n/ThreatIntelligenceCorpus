					Hacker Interviews – The Phantom Squad					
Enjoy the Interview.

You are a talented hacker that has already participated in several hacking campaigns, could you tell me more about.
We started in November 2015. We have taken down PSN and have also targeted other gaming companies. We started off as black hats.
Could you tell me which his your technical background and when you started hacking? Which are your motivations?
We were motivated because security is always weak, there is no such thing as perfect security, and there is always a vulnerability in everything and we like to exploit it.
What was your greatest hacking challenge? Which was your latest hack? Can you describe me it?
Our greatest challenge was to prove that we WERE Attacking servers ourselves, and not taking credit from other groups.
What are the 4 tools that cannot be missed in the hacker’s arsenal and why?
I can’t really answer this question. All the tools are useful somehow.
Which are the most interesting hacking communities on the web today, why?
There are many. Won’t say, They already have a lot of popularity
Did you participate in hacking attacks against the IS propaganda online? When? How?
We have not targeted any form of ISIS propaganda, we will in the near future.
Where do you find IS people to hack? How do you choose your targets?
If a group gains popularity in a bad way, We stop them from attacking and threatening online communities and services, and so far we have been successful.
We often hear about cyber weapons and cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. Do you believe it is real the risk of a major and lethal cyber attack against a critical infrastructure?  
We believe that cyber weapons are not much of a risk, as many don’t know how they work or how to use them. Thank you as well!
Thanks a lot!
