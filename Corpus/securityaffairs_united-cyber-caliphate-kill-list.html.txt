The pro-ISIS hacking group United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) has released a “kill list” containing the names and addresses of 8,786 individuals in the U.S. and UK. The group published a shocking video online calling for lone wolf attacks on the individuals in the list.
“Kill them wherever you find them.” states the message published by the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC).
The video starts with a warning for the United States:
“We have a message to the people of the U.S. and most importantly your President Trump,” the text on the screen reads. 
“Know that we continue to wage war against you. Know that your counter attacks only make us stronger. The UCC will start a new step in this war against you,” the message said.
According to according to the terror monitor SITE, the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) first announced the release of the kill list through a private group on Telegram, then published it after a few minutes.
“More than 7,000 of the names were from the U.S.,” a source from the cyber department at SITE told Fox News on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to determine where the list came from and also identify a common theme among all the individuals,” states a spokesman from SITE.

Intelligence experts are evaluating the real danger for the people included in the kill list, in the past, the same group of hackers has shared other lists.
“This group has released several ‘kill lists’ in the past and so far there’s been no confirmed incident of someone on the list being directly targeted or attacked,” the source said. 
On March 16, 2017, the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) published a video to announce the death of it leader, Osed Agha, who was killed during a US airstrike. The video promised retaliation for the death of the UCC leader.
