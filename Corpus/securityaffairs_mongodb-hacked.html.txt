					Hacker held open MongoDB databases for ransom					

“Unlike other instances he discovered in the past, this one was different. When he accessed the open server, instead of looking at the database’s content, a collection of tables, Gevers found only one table, named “WARNING”. ”  reads a blog post published on bleepingcomputer.com.
The attacker accessed the open MongoDB database, exported its content, and replaced all data with a table containing the following code:
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5859a0370b8e49f123fcc7da"), "mail" : "harak1r1@sigaint.org", "note" : "SEND 0.2 BTC TO THIS ADDRESS 13zaxGVjj9MNc2jyvDRhLyYpkCh323MsMq AND CONTACT THIS EMAIL WITH YOUR IP OF YOUR SERVER TO RECOVER YOUR DATABASE !" }

“I was able to confirm [this] because the log files show clearly that the date [at which] it was exported first and then the new database with tablename WARNING was created,” Gevers told BleepingComputer. “Every action in the database servers was being logged.”
The expert notified victims their database were hacked:
“Criminals often target open databases to deploy their activities like data theft/ransom. But we also have seen cases were open servers like these are used for hosting malware (like ransomware), botnets and for hiding files in the GridFS,” he wrote in the notification letter sent to the victims. 

In December 2015, the popular expert and Shodan creator John Matherly found over 650 terabytes of MongoDB data exposed on the Internet by vulnerable databases.
