LookingGlass Phishing Report: Top 20 Targets – May 25, 2015
 
Phishing Report: Top 20 Targets
Week of May 17-23, 2015

 
This week saw more than a 15% decrease in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking.  CIBC, Battle.net, and Adobe displaced Sparkasse, Comcast, and Lloyds TSB.
CIBC  topped the list with an increase of more than 450% from the prior week. BMO Bank of Montreal followed with an increase of more than 190%, and Facebook saw an increase of more than 85%.

USAA had the greatest drop (>40%), followed by AOL (>40%), Lloyds TSB (>35%), Google (>30%), and Comcast (>30%).
Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top brands that are being targeted in phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
LookingGlass anti-phishing experts will be presenting at the Anti-Phishing Working Group in Barcelona later this month on the use of link shorteners in phishing attacks. We will be sharing some content from the event on the LookingGlass Blog in due course!
