Now click on Audits from the left section and select the type you want to scan.

Now goto credential section and select your type and finally click on scan.

Now Retina will start scanning your network according to settings.

After few minutes your vulnerability scanning will complete.

Now go to Remediate section, in this section you can select what you want to include in your vulnerability report.

Now in Report section you can select what type of report you want to generate for your network penetration testing. Select the type of report according to your need from Report type menu and click on Generate button.
