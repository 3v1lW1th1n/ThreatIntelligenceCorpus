Israel's security minister suckers Zucker for Facebook'ed killings
Israel's Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan has blamed Facebook founder Mark Zukerberg for the killing of Hallel Ariel and Michael Marks.
The Minister told local program Meet the Press Facebook does not do enough to alert security forces to terrorist-related posts after Ariel's killer Muhammad Tarari posted to the social network his intention to commit the crime.
"I have no doubt that Facebook, today, which brought a positive revolution to the world, unfortunately since the rise of ISIS, has simply become a monster,” Erdan said.
“Some of the blood of the victims of the recent attacks, including that of Hallel, may her memory be blessed, is unfortunately on the hands of Mark Zuckerberg, because the police and security forces could have been told about the post of that vile murderer.”
Minister Erdan says Facebook "sabotaged" police through what he says is a lack of cooperation.
Facebook says it is in regular contact with security organisations and relies in part on community reports of abuse and violence.
The murders helped spark the biggest security lock down response by Israel in two years.
The lock down affects Hebron and surrounding villages with military shuttering all but one exit road. ®
