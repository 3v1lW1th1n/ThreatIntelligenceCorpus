Phishing Report: Top Targets
Week of June 21 – 27, 2015
Author: Robert McDaniel
 

This week saw more than a (>30%) decrease in phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. The biggest decreases in phishing activity were in Internet Software & Services (>90%), followed by Computer Software (>60%), and Internet Content Providers (>50%).

Our Top 20 Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
We recently announced a partnership with CYREN to incorporate their Phishing Intelligence Feed into our anti-phishing service. This provides an unparalleled view into global phishing attacks from the earliest moments, enabling us to deliver even more protection for our customers.
