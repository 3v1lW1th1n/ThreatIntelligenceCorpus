Exploiting  IntelÂ® CPU Caching.


Hi Folks,according to this post on Invisible Things, next week they'll publish a paper (within the exploit description) on privilege escalation from Ring 0 to the SMM on many of the recent motherboards with Intel CPUs. I am very curious to see what they've done. I hope the paper will be technical and procedural. I would like to see both: the process that triggered the attack and the description with technical details of the exploit which implements the attack. Anyway, I am sure it will be another incredible and amazing attack from Invisible Thinks. Thank you for sharing.
