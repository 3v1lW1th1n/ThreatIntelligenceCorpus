Weekly Phishing Report: October 31, 2016
The Internet Search & Navigation Services industry witnessed over a half of phishing activity within the top 20, making it the top sector for phishing attacks this week.
In this week’s phishing report, we saw a decrease (>5%) in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. eCommerce (>10%), Computer Hardware (>5%), and email Providers (>5%) all saw increases in activity. We saw the largest phishing decreases in Telecommunications (>50%), Electronic Payment Systems (>30%), and Banking (>15%).
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
