Mozilla Releases Open Source Masche Forensics Tool
Mozilla has released an open source memory forensics tool that some college students designed and built during the company’s recent Winter of Security event.
The new tool, known as Masche, is designed specifically for investigating server memory and has the advantage of being able to scan running processes without causing any problems with the machine. Masche runs on Linux, OS X and Windows and Mozilla has posted the code on GitHub.
“Masche provides basic primitives for scanning the memory of processes without disrupting the normal operations of a system. Compared with frameworks like Volatility or Rekall, Masche does not provide the same level of advanced forensics features. Instead, it focuses on searching for regexes and byte strings in the processes of large pools of systems, and does so live and very fast,” Julien Vehent wrote in a blog post.
“The effort needed to implement a complex scanning solution across three operating systems, and complete this work in just a few months, was no easy feat.”
The new forensics library is the work of a group of students at the University of Buenos Aires, and can be seen as a kind of companion tool to Mozilla’s InvestiGator. The MIG is more of a platform than a discrete tool, and it’s meant for investigating issues remotely.
“MIG is composed of agents installed on all systems of an infrastructure. The agents can be queried in real-time using a messenging protocol implemented in the MIG Scheduler. MIG has an API, a database, RabbitMQ relays, a terminal console and command line clients. It allows investigators to send actions to pools of agents, and check for indicator of compromise, verify the state of a configuration, block an account, create a firewall rule, update a blacklist and so on,” the InvestiGator documentation says.
Masche is meant to be a module on the MIG platform and Mozilla is now integrating the forensics tool into that platform.
