The Africa Security & Counter-Terrorism Summit held in London last Friday had some few hundred attendees consisting of ministers and government officials from over 28 countries. The Summit was well attended and certainly reached it goals, to find consensus among governments that need to improve their security.
The President of ECIPS, Ricardo Baretzky, stressed that cyber terrorism is on the rise and that African governments are not adequately protected from any cyber-attacks.
According to statistics released at the Summit, 93% of all computers were hacked or infiltrated during 2013 by either a malware or some hacking event.

In his opening speech, the President said that the terrorism threat is a very real threat and warned that governments must be vigilant and also take responsibility for their actions.
The event was also attended by many law-enforcements agents from Europe and Africa.  Among the sponsors were BBC Monitoring and several other high-tech companies in the fields of military and law-enforcement products.
President Baretzky said: “We must remember our responsibility to always protect those who are innocent and need protection, both government and civilian, and we cannot fail to take responsibility by ignoring this threat.”
A very strong massage indeed, to the governments from the BRICKS nations in Africa. Baretzky warned that a cyber-attack in the future could seriously impair the economies of the European Union and the USA.
