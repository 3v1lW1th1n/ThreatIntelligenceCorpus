The 11-Month Evolution of An0nGhost
By Chris on October 9, 2013
Hacktivist teams have garnered much attention in recent years from the threat intelligence community, and to some degree, the mainstream media. This coverage has produced a trove of information on some organizations allowing us to observe how their networks evolved via open source media analysis.
The most notorious and most amorphous collective, Anonymous, remains highly active several years after its inception. Its emergence in early 2008 serves as an epoch to the modern era of hacktivism, which Professor Gabriella Coleman at McGill University details in her excellent profile of the group.
An0nGhost is another globally distributed collective of hackers. In contrast to Anonymous, it has a recognized head figure in Mauritania Attacker and a relatively clearcut network of 25-30 affiliated hackers. The group’s entire existence has been chronicled, and we’ve described its evolution below using web intelligence and visualizations from Recorded Future.
This series of network and timeline pairings explain the evolution of An0nGhost, from the group’s foundation in November 2012 to its rumored dissolution in September 2013.




An0nGhost is one of the first non-state cyber organizations (distinct from groups such as the Syrian Electronic Army and Iran Cyber Army) during this era of heightened attention to hacktivism with both the ambitious targeting that warrants close examination and the regular disclosure of plans and successes that provide evidence for non-technical analysis of the open source.
Those non-technical insights such as patterns in targeting, methods of attack, and affiliations with other known organizations and individuals can then be leveraged by analysts in a second phase of research for technical attack indicators. You can get a taste for this next step by looking at indicators such as URLs, IPs, hashes, and more that have recently been linked to members of the An0nGhost collective.
