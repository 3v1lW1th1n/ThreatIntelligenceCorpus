Patch Flash now: Google Project Zero, Intel and pals school Adobe on security 101
Hot on the heels of Microsoft's Patch Tuesday release, Adobe has published security fixes for its Flash Player browser plugin.
The March 12 update for the internet's screen door addresses 11 CVE-listed vulnerabilities. Adobe is listing the patch as a top deployment priority for Windows, OS X and Linux systems.
Among the flaws are nine remote-code execution holes, which could be exploited to install malware or take control of a vulnerable system. Adobe said it has not received any reports of the flaws being targeted in the wild thus far – but we all know hackers love seizing these bugs to catch out people who haven't updated.
The full list of the patched vulnerabilities is as follows:
Users and administrators running Adobe Flash Player for Linux Chrome and Internet Explorer, Flash Player Extended Support Release and Flash Player Desktop Runtime are all advised to update their software to the most recent version in order to obtain the patch. El Reg advises uninstalling the plugin, or enabling 'click to play' in your browser. ®
