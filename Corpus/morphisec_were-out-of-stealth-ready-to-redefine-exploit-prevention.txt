While we have been sharing bits and pieces of Morphisec’s cyber security model over the past few weeks, I am happy to announce that we have officially come out of stealth mode.

The weeks leading up to this important milestone have been filled with meetings with analysts, industry leaders, CISOs and IT managers to validate and sharpen our concept. I’d like to offer my personal thanks to everyone that took the time to meet with us and offered valuable insight and feedback. It has been great to see that so many people share our excitement about Morphisec’s innovative approach, and we are confident that we will fulfill our mission of giving enterprises the upper hand against cybercriminals.

Coming out of stealth means that from now on you will see more communication from us about our unique Moving Target Defense technology – on our blog, website, social media and in relevant online media. So stay tuned to these channels to learn more details about our core product, the Endpoint Protector, and how it works. If you want to make sure to stay in the loop, drop us a line and we will add you to our newsletter.

Special Thanks to the Morphisec Dream Team
Last, but not least, I would like to thank the entire Morphisec team that has been toiling endlessly behind the scenes to turn Moving Target Defense into a unique advanced threat prevention and intelligence solution. Thanks to your dedication, we have what it takes to overcome hackers and cyber criminals, and disrupt the economics of security in favor of the defending companies.
