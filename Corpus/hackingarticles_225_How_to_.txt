How to view Date & Time of any Captured JPEG Image

ExifDataView is a small utility that reads and displays the Exif data stored inside .jpg image files generated by digital cameras. The EXIF data includes the name of the company created the camera, camera model, the date/time that the photograph was taken, Exposure Time, ISO Speed, GPS information (for digital cameras with GPS), and more.

Photo Studio is a useful tool for exploring the Meta data stored along with your image files. The program supports a wide variety of Meta data standards, including EXIF, CIFF, Olympus, JFIF and Photoshop. EXIF data will be of particular interest to digital camera users â€“ it is the format used by most digital cameras to store camera settings along with an image.
