Sex and social media is a dangerous mix abused by cyber criminals to hit a large number of users of most popular social networks. In the last couple of years the number of illicit activities on the social networks is sensibly increased, malware based attacks and phishing are the most common type of attacks. A new clickjacking scam campaign is causing serious problems to Facebook users, attackers are spamming Facebook timeline with a friend’s picture with the message
“See (Friend)’s naked video,” 
or 
“(Friend Name’s) Private Video.“
