Cisco Videoscape bug could bring endless repeats to your tellie
Cisco is asking Web broadcasters using its Videoscape TV-over-IP streaming product to get patching, after a denial-of-service vulnerability was found in the software.
The system, kicked off in 2011 and rolled into a bigger “Evolved Services Platform” in 2014, is a cloudy PVR with transcoder and video optimisation.
The Borg's advisory says an input validation bug (CVE-2015-0725) in the Videoscape Distribution Suite's HTTP processing module lets attackers force reloads over HTTP.
“Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow the attacker to trigger device instability and could cause a device to reload. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition,” the advisory says.
There is a patch, but there's no workaround before the patch is applied. ®
