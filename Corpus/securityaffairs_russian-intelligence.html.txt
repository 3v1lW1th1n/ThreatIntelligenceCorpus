While security experts and the US law enforcement speculate the involvement of Russian state-sponsored hackers behind the DNC hack, the Federal Security Service, the FSB, announced the discovery of a spyware in state computer networks.
The news was first reported the Reuters agency today, Saturday, June 30, networks belonging to at least 20 organizations were infected by a malware as part of a coordinated attack.
“Russia’s intelligence service said on Saturday that the computer networks of 20 organizations, including state agencies and defense companies, have been infected with spyware in what it described as a targeted and coordinated attack.” reported the blog post published by the Reuters.

The FSB hasn’t provided further details about the attack, its experts found many similarities to other attacks that hit Russian entities and other targets worldwide. At the time I was writing the Russian authorities haven’t provided information about who is behind the attacks.
“Information technology resources of government agencies, scientific and military institutions, defense industry companies and other entities involved in crucial infrastructure have been infected,” reads the announcement published by the FSB on its website.
As always happens in these cases, the nature of the attack and of the chosen targets lead the experts into believing that the attack was launched by a nation-state actor.
