                  Step 5: Automation is Key                
Automate Repetitive Tasks and Spend Time on Real Threats
This is the fifth of a six-blog series that will address how to make the most of your cybersecurity program, especially if you have a small (or growing) team.
We’ve already covered gathering and correlating threat data, determining threat data relevance, prioritizing threat data, and sharing threat data. In case you missed it, Steps 1-4 can be found on the ThreatConnect blog or youtube channel. 
The next step is: automating manual tasks to increase team efficiency. 
Cybersecurity teams receive thousands of alerts each day. So the question becomes: How do you take action on minimizing the number of alerts, or automate certain tasks so you can spend your time on actual threats? 
This is where ThreatConnect comes in. ThreatConnect recently added orchestration capabilities to their platform. ThreatConnect now provides automated and configurable ‘Playbooks’ – or automated chains of events that are triggered by an event in your network. 
Playbooks are started by what is called a ‘trigger’ in the Platform - a specific action that indicates the Playbook should begin. Then, you can tie together specific actions into one automated chain of events. You can build a Playbook to unite any of your other tools like a firewall or a SIEM; take actions in the Platform such as sending alerts, take blocking actions, and enriching data, or even assigning tasks to people - all through this playbook interface. 
You can also create rules in your Playbooks. For example, telling the Playbook to send an alert if an enrichment source finds that an indicator is potentially malicious.To put it simply, you can automate nearly any cybersecurity operation or task. And, everything is drag-and-drop, so there’s no coding needed.
Playbooks gives the power back to you - and your team - so you can finally automate repetitive actions and spend time on what matters. Having your aggregated and enriched threat intelligence in the same place as your orchestration capabilities gives you a more focused, efficient, and effective response to threats – all without having to expand your team or buy more tools.
