Get avast! Free Antivirus or a „free“ upgrade with the Alureon rootkit











Threat Intelligence Team, 1 March 2010

Get avast! Free Antivirus or a „free“ upgrade with the Alureon rootkitavast! Free Antivirus can be downloaded for free from our servers or from other download servers such as download.com, 01.fr and others.  But why limit yourself to avast! Free Antivirus if there are other products available with additional functionality that can be downloaded for free?
At least, that is what some people are thinking.
Last week when I was checking files submitted as false positive alerts, l was looking to verify accurate, 100%  detections. There were a few files named AIS (Avast Internet suite)  from  megaupload and uploading.com servers. Bad guys take our product, add an Alureon rootkit file (typically under the name codec.exe) and make new setup file with Nullsoft installer.
avast! detected this and put the infected files in the Virus Chest.
But, the story is not over. Some thieves are so cheeky, they reported this to us as a false positive. They should really be sending us a thank you note.
One advice to thieves: Be careful with what you are stealing. An active rootkit in your  system is a hard task for any newly installed antivirus solution.
