Weekly Phishing Report: August 1, 2016
Week of July 24 – July 30, 2016

In this week’s phishing report, we saw a >25% decrease in overall phishing activity for the top 20 brands we’re tracking, grouped by industry. Internet and Information Services (>60%), Electronic Payment Systems (>30%), and Internet Search & Navigation Services (>25%) saw the biggest decreases in activity.
Our Phishing Report offers a snapshot into the weekly trends of the top industries that are being targeted by phishing attacks. By pulling information from major ISPs, partners, clients, feeds, and our own proprietary honeypots and web crawlers, we are able to get a 360-degree view of the phishing landscape. The percentages posted on our blog are based on the sum of the phishing threats of the top 20 brands, and do not include anything below the top 20 threshold.
