					National Security Agency opens the NSA Github Account that already lists 32 Projects					
The National Security Agency has opened its GitHub account and presented an official GitHub page. The US intelligence agency employees numerous excellent experts that in the past demonstrated extraordinary abilities in developing hacking tools, exploits and surveillance solutions.
The work of the NSA experts was secret until the Snowden’s revelations, but now the Agency seems to be more social and the creation of the Github account demonstrates it.
Giving a look at the GitHub account we can notices that the NSA is sharing 32 different projects as part of the NSA Technology Transfer Program (TTP), while some of these are ‘coming soon.’
“The NSA Technology Transfer Program (TTP) transfers NSA-developed technology to industry, academia, and other research organizations, benefitting the economy and the Agency mission. The program has an extensive portfolio of patented technologies across multiple technology areas” states the description of the NSA program.
Many projects shared by the NSA are very old and were already available online, such as the SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux).
“The NSA Technology Transfer Program (TTP) works with agency innovators who wish to use this collaborative model for transferring their technology to the commercial marketplace,” the agency wrote on the program’s page. 
“OSS invites the cooperative development of technology, encouraging broad use and adoption. The public benefits by adopting, enhancing, adapting, or commercializing the software. The government benefits from the open source community’s enhancements to the technology.”
