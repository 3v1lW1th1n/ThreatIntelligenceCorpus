Marie Moe on Medical Device Security
Marie Moe, a research scientist at SINTEF of Norway, talks to Mike Mimoso about her personal and emotional connection to medical device security given that she has a pacemaker implanted in her that regulates her heart.
Moe, who is in her 30s, has been active in spurring research into the security of implantable cardiac devices and shares her intimate story on the podcast. Moe has also been active in advocating for more research into medical device vulnerabilities and made an impassioned call to action to do so in Wired last year. She has also given several talks on the subject at technical conferences, below, and urges organizations to examine and adopt the recent FDA guidelines on medical device security.
