A recent survey conducted by the U.S. government found that over half of all American internet users have cut back on their online activity due to cyber security concerns. In particular, many of these concerns related to identity theft as tens of millions of people have lost private information over the past few years. The infographic shared below, which was created by Norwich University’s Online Masters Degree in Information Assurance program, highlights deep web crime and identity theft by noting a number of astonishing statistics, such as that the yearly revenue of deep web illegal activity exceeds approximately $100,000,000. For more information, check out the full visual resource below.
