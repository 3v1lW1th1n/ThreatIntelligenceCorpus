FBI says Apple ID heist claim is TOTALLY FALSE
Popcorn time Hot on the heels of AntiSec’s claim that the purloined Apple device IDs it dumped to Pastebin came from the FBI, the G-men have flatly denied the story.
In a statement e-mailed to the press, the FBI says simply:
The FBI is aware of published reports alleging that an FBI laptop was compromised and private data regarding Apple UDIDs was exposed. At this time there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or that the FBI either sought or obtained this data.
On Twitter, the FBI was even more blunt:
Statement soon on reports that one of our laptops with personal info was hacked. We never had info in question. Bottom Line: TOTALLY FALSE
Of course, tinfoil-hatters will remind the world “they would say that, wouldn’t they?”, but it’s now over to AntiSec to back its claim.
Meanwhile, trawling the database of UDIDs, Cultofmac is making the extraordinary and probably unprovable claim that President Obama's UDID is among those on the list leaked by AntiSec.
That claim comes from a PasteHTML search on the UDIDs (which page, by the way, allows anyone to check if their UDID was leaked). Exactly how the search conclusively ties the named device to the Leader of the Free World isn't exactly clear to El Reg. ®
