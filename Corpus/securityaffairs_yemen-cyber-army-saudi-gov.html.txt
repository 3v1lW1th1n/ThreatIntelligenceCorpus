The data includes emails, personal and secret information of Government staff and diplomats engaged in different missions around the world and strategic planning documents. The group claimed that it “has gained access to the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) network, but most disconcerting news it that they sustain to have the full control over more than 3000 computers and servers, and thousands of users.

The hackers also anticipated the automatic wipe off the Saudi Foreign Ministry computer systems and servers at 12:00 Wednesday midnight, and it has succeeded as reported by zone-h.
Lee Johnstone of cyberwarnews.info (@Cyber_War_News) has analyzed some of the massive amount of documents included in the data dump released by the Yemen Cyber Army.
The amount of data is impressive, 892 mb archive contains 1,835 files in 93 folders.
Lee confirmed the presence of documents, emails, presentations, images, and spreadsheets, approximately 95% of which are in Arabic.
“The e-mail documents are Outlook files, sorted by the inbox status. Emails account for 1,622 files, 38 Folders, and 647 mb of the data. Lee also found what he described as “tons of internal network information including root certificates.” One file of note includes a spreadsheet with 19,577 records with the following fields of citizen information” reported Databreaches.
The group announced that this is just the beginning, they will release more information gradually, announcing that they have compromised also Saudi Interior Ministry (MOI) and Defense Ministry (MOD).
“We have the same access to the Interior Ministry (MOI) and Defense Ministry (MOD) of which the details will be published in near future. Wish such shocking news make Saudi dictators to come to their senses and recapture those young wild dogs’ leash to avoid Muslims exploiting hate against Saudi family. If you did not stop attacks on Muslims in Yemen, do not blame anyone but yourself and expect greater harms.”
The Fars news agency also published a document that includes the links of the files and the documents released by the Yemen Cyber Army.
