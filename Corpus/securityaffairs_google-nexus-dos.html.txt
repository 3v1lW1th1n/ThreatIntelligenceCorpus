The popular family of Smartphones Google Nexus is vulnerable to SMS-based DOS attack that could cause the handset freeze and other anomalous behaviors.
Bogdan Alecu, a system administrator at Dutch IT services company Levi9, discovered the Google Nexus vulnerability that affects all  Android 4.x firmware versions on Google Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 and Nexus 5.
The expert disclosed the vulnerability recently in the DefCamp security conference in Bucharest, Romania.
An attacker exploiting the flaw can force mobile device to restart, loose network connection or freeze by sending a large number of a special type of SMS messages, flash SMS.

“Then my first thought was: what happens if I send more such messages? Will it make the entire background go black? If so, wouldn’t this cause a memory leak? The answer is “Yes” for both of the questions. So, basically, by sending around 30 Class 0 messages, it will make the Google device behave strangely’.” said Alecu to my colleagues at the TheHackerNews.
