					Chrome evolves security indicators by marking with a red warning for HTTP content					
Since January 2017, Chrome indicates connection security with an icon in the address bar labeling HTTP connections to sites as non-secure, while since May 2017 Google is marking newly registered sites that serve login pages or password input fields over HTTP as not secure.
Back to the present, in May 2018 the overall encrypted traffic for several Google products is more than over 93%.
“Security is a top priority at Google. We are investing and working to make sure that our sites and services provide modern HTTPS by default. Our goal is to achieve 100% encryption across our products and services. The chart below shows how we’re doing across Google.” reads the Google Transparency report.
This is an important success for Google, consider that early 2014 only 50% of the traffic was encrypted.
According to the Google Transparency report, around 75% of the pages loaded via Chrome early May 2018 were served over secure HTTPS connections, while in 2014 the percentage was only around 40%.
Given now plan to mark unencrypted connections with a red “Not Secure” warning.
“Previously, HTTP usage was too high to mark all HTTP pages with a strong red warning, but in October 2018 (Chrome 70), we’ll start showing the red “not secure” warning when users enter data on HTTP pages,” reads a blog post published by Google.

“We hope these changes continue to pave the way for a web that’s easy to use safely, by default. HTTPS is cheaper and easier than ever before, and unlocks powerful capabilities — so don’t wait to migrate to HTTPS! Check out our set-up guides to get started.” explained Emily Schechter, Product Manager, Chrome Security”
