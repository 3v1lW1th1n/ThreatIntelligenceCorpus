PS3, Good Job George.


You're right George, the idea is pretty easy, BUT the implementation ....  WOW  ! I really enjoined the way you hooked up the bus and injected junk bytes ... I know you're working to this projects from many years, you really deserve all the credit of this hacks. !Now for folks who doesn't know what I'm talking about, here  one of the best articles to understand what he did.  And here you can download the PS3 Exploit . If you click on those links there will be adv and then rapid share ... blah blah blah... I know.. you can find it just googling without ADV and RapidShare. I have my personal Collector on Rapid Share, and I really wanna keep the orginal PS3 exploit by George, so I putted it into my own collection. So if you wanna download it through my pages, please be patient about that.
