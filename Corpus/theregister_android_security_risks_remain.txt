Android, heal thyself
Podcast Google's Android mobile operating system is now on a par with others when it comes to security, says Accuvant security researcher Joshua Drake, aka jduck.
But there are still problems in the operating system, not least a staggered update process.
Then there's webkit, which permeates the operating system but is developed independently of Android. Webkit therefore presents a considerable challenge, as it's hard for developers to avoid, but also hard to understand when planning the security for an app or online service for an Android device.
In this podcast recorded at the Ruxcon Breakpoint conference in Melbourne earlier this month, Drake and Patrick Gray delve into Android security and ask whether Google has dodged a bullet, given the OS was rushed to market in a less-than-marvellously-secure state.
