But what if the links are coming from a very well known Security solutions vendor such as Kaspersky? For sure people will trust the links. So, through “Unvalidated Redirection Vulnerability” in Kaspersky, attackers will be able to spread a link coming from Kaspersky.com but when the user clicks on that link, he will get redirected to the attacker’s website which would download at Malware on their machines or even download a “Rogue Antivirus” to steal financial information such as credit card information!” explained Ebrahim Hegazy.
After the researcher reported the vulnerability to Kaspersky team, it took about 2 months to fix the vulnerability, it is really a long time considering that if a hacker had found this flaw before Hagazy he could spread links using Kaspersky.com.
The consequences of unfixing of such vulnerability are critical
