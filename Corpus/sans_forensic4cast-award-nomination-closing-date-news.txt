Well here it is: March 31, 2017.I will be accepting nominations as long as it is still March 31 somewhere in the world. I will then spend a couple of days tallying the nominations before revealing the final 3 for each category in the voting stage.Don't forget that the awards will take place at the SANS DFIR Summit 2017 in Austin, Texas. The summit runs June 22-23 but SANS also runs classes through June 29. This is a great opportunity to take that SANS class you've been eyeing for a few months. Most of the classes have had significant updates in the last few months..Details can be found here: https://www.sans.org/event/digital-forensics-summit-2017/Also, I'm going to be speaking at EnFuse in Las Vegas this year. The dates are May 22-25, 2017 and the conference is held at Caesar's Palace.I'll also be giving the same presentation at the SANS DFIR Summit in June. Check out the impressive DFIR Summit Agenda: https://www.sans.org/event/digital-forensics-summit-2017/summit-overview/Speaking of SANS, I've recently left Digital Discovery to take a position with the SANS Online Training team as a Subject Matter Expert. That means that if you have a question about one of the DFIR classes, I'll probably be answering it. I also get to test the labs for the classes and do a bunch of other fun stuff. I'm really looking forward to it.Here are some pictures of last years' Forensic 4:cast Awards at the DFIR Summit 2016!      Hope to see you all at this year's DFIR Summit in June!
