Google Fixes Three High-Risk Flaws in Chrome
There is a trio of high-risk security vulnerabilities in Google Chrome that have been patched in a new version of the browser released on Tuesday.
The vulnerabilities all are use-after-free bugs, and Google paid a total of $5,000 in rewards to researchers who discovered and reported them. Google also said that there were several security issues found by the company’s internal security team, which it doesn’t typically break out into individual flaws.
The new version of Chrome is sort of an atypical release for Google. The company updates the browser quite often, but many of the releases include a larger number of security fixes than version 30.0.1599.101 released today. The full list of vulnerabilities fixed in this version are:
