Atalla the hun(ter) leads HP cloud security invasion
HP has revealed a bunch of security analytics tools and services as part of an infosec portfolio launch.
The company reckons the IT industry isn't keeping up with security threats, so it's pushing a focus on “the interactions between users, applications and data”.
To that end, there's additions to ArcSight, a new cloud security platform; HP Fortify on Demand gets better BYOD security, and HP Threat Central has gone general availability.
ArcSight, which HP acquired in 2010, gets a User Behavioural Analytics module developed in partnership with Securonix.
Designed to track “malicious or negligent users”, HP says the module works against baseline enterprise activity data to detect both internal and external threats.
HP's Atalla cloud access security platform is being enhanced with monitoring, governance and control capabilities developed in partnership with Adallom.
There's also a value-added offering for Atalla, Information Protection and Control, for data classification, and automatic encryption for files moving moving in or out of the cloud, or between cloud platforms.
HP Threat Central takes intelligence feeds from the likes of AlienVault and Crowdstrike to try and keep ahead of emerging threats.
BYOD security is enhanced, the company says, with a mobile reputation database added to the cloud-based Fortify on Demand portfolio.
This lets customers request a free reputation and behavioural analysis of both company-owned mobile apps, and those in app stores. ®
