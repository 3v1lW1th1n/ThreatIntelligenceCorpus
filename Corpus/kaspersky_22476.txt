GDPR: What it is, and what businesses should do
Ongoing digital transformation has carried us right into the data-centric age: personal data is everywhere. Data subjects do not always realize how their data is handled, or who has access to it. What is even worse, organizations are sometimes careless about how they handle this data — and how they bring it online. That creates a surge of opportunities for data hunters of all kinds. The EU General Data Protection Regulation is an attempt to address those problems.
GDPR suggests an ongoing process focused on ensuring that data subjects have real control over their personally identifiable information — and ensuring companies use it lawfully and handle it securely. It helps give both data controllers and data processors a clearer understanding of their responsibilities.

This regulation is about ensuring that the processes and technologies used for personal data safekeeping follow the Regulation and are effectively implemented. Therefore, compliance is not a one-time task, something that is simply accomplished; you will need to assess and adjust regularly. Compliance lies not just in following the letter of the law but also in taking a practical approach to ensuring data security — which you can accomplish by continuously tuning your processes and countermeasures.
Of course, implementing effective cybersecurity technologies does not equal GDPR compliance. However, cybersecurity is among the cornerstones on which this compliance is built. We have some practical advice on how to strengthen it.
