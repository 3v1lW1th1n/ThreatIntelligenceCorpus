Reflections on Know Your Foe
Back in June, when Steve and I re-designed our website, one fact was clear â€“ we wanted to provide a quick summary of the analysis workflow and thus, the learn page was born. Inspired by the success of the page, we began the Know Your Foe blog series to tackle some of the many challenges analysts face when researching threat infrastructure.
We didnt think it would gain as much traction as it has, but weve had amazing feedback from the community and demand for more detailed information. While the series itself has come to an end, our work has not. To keep up with interest, Steve and I have developed a threat infrastructure analysis training. If you or your organization has interest, send us a message to info[@]passivetotal.org.
Havent heard of the series? Heres a listing of our entries and a slide deck from our recent talk given at HITCON Enterprise in Taiwan.
