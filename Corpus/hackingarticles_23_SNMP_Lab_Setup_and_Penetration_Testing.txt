SNMP Lab Setup and Penetration Testing

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol for network management. It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It usually run on UDP port 161.
Download Vyos Link: https://downloads.vyos.io/?dir=release/1.1.8
Create New Virtual Machine using the VMware and change the Network Adapter to Bridged as shown in the given screenshot.

After completing the initial setup in the VMware Boot the Newly created Virtual Machine by clicking on the Power on the Virtual Machine.
The Default Login Credentials for Vyos are
Username: vyos
Password: vyos
The Initial Boot of Vyos will be as shown below:

This is a Live Boot of the vyos, so we will install the vyos to use it properly.
We will use the iso image to install vyos. Type the following command:
Command: install image

Enter “Yes” where it asks to continue.
Next it will ask about the partition management.
Enter “Auto” where it asks about Partition.

It will detect the drives in the Virtual System and ask you to select the particular drive in which you want to install vyos.

Enter “sda” where it asks about the location for installation.
Next it will ask about the size for the root partition for the vyos.

You can enter any size from 1000MB to 21474MB. But it is recommended to keep it maximum i.e. 21474MB.
Next it will ask about the name for the image.

By default the name is set to the version number that is 1.1.8. You can either give a personalised name or you can leave it default.
Next it will ask about the location to copy the sda.

It is recommended to keep it default.
After that it will ask for the password to be kept for the administrator account.
By default it is kept vyos. But from security point of view it is recommended to change it to something complex which is difficult to guess or brute force.

Now it will ask for the drive on which you want to setup GRUB Boot-loader? Again leave it default to “sda”.

After that we have completed the vyos setup. Reboot using the command
Command: reboot
After reboot it will ask for login credentials, Enter the credential that you entered during the installation.
Now we will configure the Network Interface. To do that, we will have to enter configuration mode.
Command: configure
After entering into configuration mode set up Network interface
Syntax: set interface ethernet [network interface] address [Static IPv4 Address]
Command: set interface ethernet eth0 address 192.168.1.125/24
Now Commit and Save the Configuration
Command: commit
Command: save
After that type “exit” to get out of configuration mode and then reboot the machine using “reboot” command
We are rebooting because the configuration changes come in effect only after a reboot.

You can the view interface which we configured by using the command
Command: show interfaces
Note: Above command will run in configuration mode.

Start SNMP service
Now we will set up the snmp service in the Vyos.
For that we will enter configuration mode using command
Command: configure
Now to set up a snmp service we will need to add a community string and give it an authorization. To do that:
Syntax: set service snmp community [community-string] authorization [auth-mode]
[community-string]: It can be anything but normally it is either public or private. But from a security point of view it is recommended to keep it that cannot be easily guessed or bruteforced.
[auth-mode]: It is the Authorization Mode. We have two options
Command: set service snmp community ignite123 authorization ro
Command: set service snmp community ignite321 authorization rw

Now let’s set a user for the system.
Firstly Enter the Configuration Mode.
Command: configure
Now to add a user we will use the following command,
Syntax: set system login user [username] authentication plaintext-password [password]
Command: set system login user ignite authentication plaintext-password ignite123
After this commit the configuration and save it. Also reboot the machine so that changes may take effect.
We have successfully completed snmp Lab in Vyos.

Now that we have setup a snmp service let’s pentest it through kali linux inbuilt tools one by one, where We can read and extract information using the community string that have the authorization of reading only but to change the information we will have to use the community string with the read and write authorization.
Let’s check using nmap in Kali Linux Machine which is running on the same network.
nmap –sU –p161, 162 192.168.1.125
[-sU]: UDP Ports as SNMP service runs on UDP port
[-p]: Specify Port Number; SNMP service runs on port 161 and 162
From given below image you can observed that it has also shown port 161 is open.

snmpwalk is an SNMP application that uses SNMP GETNEXT requests to query a network entity for a tree of information.
Command: snmpwalk -v1 –c ignite321 192.168.1.125
Here
[-v1]: Level of verbose mode
[-c]: Community String
From given below image you can observe all details that are specified for “STRING”

Snmpwalk
We can manipulate these details using the iso id, using another tool snmpset. Here we are renaming the host string from vyos to hacked
Command: snmpset –v1 –c ignite321 192.168.1.125 iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0.s Hacked 

Let’s check if the changes we implemented had an effect using snmpwalk
Command: snmpwalk –v1 –c ignite321 192.168.1.125 
As you can see that the we have successfully change the host name from vyos to hacked. 

We can extract a number of information using snmpwalk
Command: snmpwalk –v1 –c ignite321 192.168.1.125 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2

Command: snmpwalk –v1 -c ignite321 192.168.1.125 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3 

Command: snmpwalk –v1 –c ignite321 192.168.1.125 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2

As the data extracted by snmp walk is quite large we can extract that into a text file by using command below
Command: snmpwalk –v1 -c ignite321 192.168.1.125 > snmpout.txt
We can use gedit to view the extracted information
Command: gedit snmpout.txt  


Like to snmpwalk, snmp-check allows you to enumerate the SNMP devices and places the output in a very human readable friendly format. It could be useful for penetration testing or systems monitoring.
Command: snmp-check 192.168.1.125 -p 161 -c ignite123
Here,
[-p]: To specify port
[-c]: To specify Community String

Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course making SNMP queries – but unlike snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process. Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.
Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries like net-snmp.
Syntax: braa [Community-string]@[IP of SNMP server]:[iso id]
Command: braa ignite123@192.168.1.125:.1.3.6.*

We can enumerate SNMP using a Metasploit module called snmp_enum.
use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum
msf auxiliary(scanner/snmp/snmp_enum) > set rhosts 192.168.1.125
msf auxiliary(scanner/snmp/snmp_enum) > set community ignite123
msf auxiliary(scanner/snmp/snmp_enum) > run
We have fetched same result from metasploit as above.
