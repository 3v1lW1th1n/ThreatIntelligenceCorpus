Security awareness for local public administrations
Cyberprotection used to be a topic understandable to only a small group of professionals, but over the past few years it’s become a mainstream subject interesting not only to businesses, but also to individuals and even local administrations. This transformation is particularly noticeable in the European Union. The European Commission recently initiated project COMPACT (COmpetitive Methods to protect local Public Administration from Cyber security Threats) to help local public administrations become more cyberresilient. We contribute to COMPACT’s efforts with our security awareness solutions.
Project COMPACT itself is meant to be a comprehensive ecosystem that can serve as a platform for the sharing of knowledge and best practices, monitoring, discussion, and training. All European local public administrations (LPAs) will be able to access this platform. Several collaborators are working on the initiative. Our part is security training based on gamification principles.
This task is of prime importance because human error is behind so many security incidents that lead to data leaks. And the main asset of LPAs is the personal data of their local citizens. That is why, as a part of our contribution to the project, we are developing a Kaspersky Interactive Protection Simulation scenario with a particular focus on protecting personal data. It’s especially relevant in light of the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which recently came into effect.
Along with series of exercises and training units, Kaspersky Interactive Protection Simulation will enable public administration employees not only to understand cybercrime, but also to transform that understanding into positive behavior models, so that when they need to make security-related decisions in the moment, they will be ready.
