MSFT kicks Chinese partner over security leak
Six weeks after Microsoft was accused of leaking attack code for a security flaw, Redmond has pointed the finger at a Chinese firewall company and revoked its partner status.
Via its Computer Security Response blog, Microsoft’s Director of Trustworthy Computing, Yunsun Wee, has tersely announced the decision, writing “we determined that a member of the MAPP (Microsoft Active Protections Program) program, Hangzhou DPTech … had breached our non-disclosure agreement.”
Wee also said Microsoft will strengthen the protections under the program.
In mid-March, Microsoft had warned that the critical RDP bugs were likely to be exploited, and within 72 hours of the warning, proof-of-concept code had appeared in China. Sophos warned at the time that it had seen attempts to exploit the flaw.
After the leak, Italian security researcher Luigi Auriemma who reported the vulnerability to Microsoft had accused Redmond of leaking the exploit code.
In other news, Microsoft has released its pre-brief for next week’s Patch Tuesday. Users should expect updates covering Windows, .NET, Silverlight, and Office, protecting against remote code execution and privilege escalation bugs. ®
