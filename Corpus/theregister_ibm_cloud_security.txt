Big Blue brandishes Big Brother bundle, bars big biz byte blab blunders
IBM has been buying up a load of computer security firms over the past three years to strengthen its chops in the area – and now it has decided to take that gobbled tech to the cloud, and dubbed it Dynamic Cloud Security (DCS).
During the past year, more than 200 IBM engineers have been working on glueing together the bought-up technology and making it ready for cloud deployment, Marc van Zadelhoff, IBM's VP of strategy for security systems told The Register.
That effort involved taking 12 acquired security products and melding them into a protection system for public, private, and hybrid clouds: the goal is to allow IT managers to see and control what is being done to data by users at all times.
In short, Big Blue reckons DCS can "automatically discover, classify and assess sensitive data stored in cloud-hosted repositories, including activity monitoring for both structured and unstructured data."
"It's a lot of work across a lot of segments," van Zadelhoff commented on the effort to bring together the gobbled security firms.
"Some of these we've radically reinvented as a service, while others are taking hosted and on-premises capabilities. It's aimed at enterprises taking valuable information onto the cloud and allowing them to take the security with them."
DCS covers what IBM says are three key areas of protecting cloud data: managing access, hardening applications, and protecting data. Pricing depends on how much of DCS you want to use, the number of accounts being covered, and the amount of data involved.
The service will roll out on Amazon Web Services and IBM's own Softlayer systems. Big Blue said using its new offering on Microsoft Azure will be possible at a later point, but couldn’t say why exactly. ®
