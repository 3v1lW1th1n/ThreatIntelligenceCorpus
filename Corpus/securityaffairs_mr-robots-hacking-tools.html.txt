Mr. Robot has been the breakthrough of summer for series lovers, especially for those who are fans of technology and computing. One of the major advantages of Mr. Robot over other series has been the realistic tone that has been given, as far as the hacking tools are concerned.

Even the figure of Rami Malek as Elliot Alderson, the vigilante – security analyst who stars the show, has been depicted realistically with the hoodie and with the mentality of a person who seeks to balance between technology and real life. Now that the show has been renewed for a second season, it is high time we had a look at the hacking tools used by Mr. Robot!

Of course, the society where Mr. Robot is represented communicates via IRC and social media, while there are many tricks and details that reveal a realistic pattern. Let’s pay attention to the hacking tools, shall we?
It is really encouraging that Mr. Robot goes to such extents to offer realistic hacking tools. So, make sure to check the series and find out why all this fuss is about – you will be hooked!
