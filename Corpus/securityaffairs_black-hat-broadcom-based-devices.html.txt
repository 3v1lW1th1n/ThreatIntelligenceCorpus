					Black Hat is coming and with it a good reason to update your “Broadcom-based” devices					
Black Hat 2017 is debuting in 3 days and with it a potential concern to most of us. It turns out that one of the conference presentations, entitled BROADPWN: REMOTELY COMPROMISING ANDROID AND IOS VIA A BUG IN BROADCOM’S WI-FI CHIPSETS [1], will detail how Broadcom BCM43xx Wi-Fi chipsets can be exploited to achieve full code execution on the compromised device without user interaction.
“An attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip”, says Apple about this vulnerability (CVE-2017–9417) in today’s security bulletin [2].

Besides Apple, those chipsets are present on most smartphone devices like HTC, LG, Nexus and most Samsung models as well. Make sure to have this vulnerability fixed on all your devices — especially if you are planning to be in Las Vegas next week.
