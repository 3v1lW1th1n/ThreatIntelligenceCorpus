GSM Cracking Tool. Yes it's open source


Hey Folks,this morning I am pleased to introduce the following open source framework named A5/1.This project aims at publicizing cryptographic weaknesses found in today's cellular networks. We are not advocating to exploit these weaknesses but rather want to inform about the fact that GSM calls are already being intercepted and decrypted using commercial tools.Some words from Frank A. Stevenson about his project:I am pleased to announce the first release of a A5/1 cracker capable using the full Berlin set of rainbow tables for lookups. I have named this beast Kraken, after a Norse mythological creature capable of eating many things for breakfast. Kraken feeds of an exclusive diet of A5/1 encrypted data.  Currently only a bare bone functionality is present, but the UI will be improved, with the specific goal of providing an easy to use tool for cracking GSM intercepts. But setting up this Leviathan can a bit cumbersome, so I will give a short howto here:Prerequisites:* Linux machine, multicore min 3GB RAM* 1.7 - 2TB of HD partitions without filsystem ( ex Samsung spinpointF3s, with 4k aligned start of partition )* The Berlin A5/1 Rainbow table set* GPU support will be added for ATI Radeon HDSetup:Find out how many tables you want on each partition, (usually roughlyequal on each) and make the initial configuration file. An exampleconfiguration folder can be found in tinkering/A5Util/indexes. Thisfolder should contain a tables.conf file. The example files shows asetup of 4 disk having 10 tables each. The index files for the varioustables will be added to the index folder as they are written to disk.The first section of the config file needs to be set up with the list ofavailable partitions, and the number of tables that each partitionshould hold. A single table needs 42GB of space. (Do NOT change theorder of this section)For safety reasons it is best not to build the tables running as root.The you will then have to make your table partitions user accessible.Add a file such as 10-disk.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d with one line foreach partition:KERNEL=="sda1", OWNER="frank"Then manually change the ownership of the device nodes with chown. Takecare when doing this, as you do not want to nuke any of your systempartitions.Add tables to your disk array:First build and make a symlink from your index folder to theTableConvert tool. It is assumed that the Berlin tables are available ineither SSD or index free delta format. The python script Behemoth.pywill recursively search for tables, and add them to the disk array andconfiguration file as needed. (Duplicates will not be added) - Thisoperation(s) will take some hours to complete, but when done you shouldend up with a tables.conf file listing ~40 tables, their advanceparameter (id), which device they reside on, and a block offset into thedevice.Build and fire up Kraken:./kraken path_to_index_folderCurrently it will only load up all tables, and crack TDMA burst 998 forthe challenge data. This takes 1.5 minutes on a 4 core Phenom II usingonly CPU power, and the output should look like:Cracking001101110011000000001000001100011000100110110110011011010011110001101010100100101111111010111100000110101001101011Found de6bb5e60617f95c @ 12Found 6fb7905579e28bfc @ 23A more interactive UI with appropriate data formats (representations)will be added for easy interfacing with airprobe. Optional GPU supportwill also be added for faster cracking time.
