MS warns of bumper patch batch
Microsoft is having an especially bulky Patch Tuesday, with the release of ten updates - six of which will address critical flaws.
The June edition of the software giant's Patch Tuesday update cycle will bring critical security fixes for flaws in IE, Windows (two) and Microsoft Office components (three). As usual there's not much by way of detail just yet, aside from the warning that all six flaws create a means to inject hostile code onto vulnerable systems.
Four “important” updates address a quarter of lesser security vulnerabilities in various (unspecified) Windows components.
All supported versions of Windows are affected, although client systems are more at risk than those running Redmond's Server software. Vista is better protected against the Windows flaws than XP, for example, but it is still just as badly exposed to the IE vulnerabilities.
Most systems will need to be rebooted after the updates are applied. More information (but not much more) can be found in Microsoft's alert here. ®
