This is the main interface of KFSensor where you can see each and every visit with deep details. You can view visitors by ports as well as by IP address.

So now if an intruder tries to scan or attack your system KFSensor will show them a simulated vulnerable machine and records their IP address, protocols, type of attack or scan they are performing, etc.
