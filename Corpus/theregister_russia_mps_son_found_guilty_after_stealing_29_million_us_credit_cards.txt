Russia MP's son found guilty after stealing 2.9 million US credit cards
The son of a Russian member of parliament has been found guilty of stealing and selling millions of US credit card numbers using point of sales malware.
Roman Seleznev, 32, is the son of ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party MP Valery Seleznev. He was arrested in 2014 while attempting to board a plane in the Maldives, sparking anger from Russian authorities.
Seleznev said at the time the arrest was a "monstrous lie and a provocative act".
Roman Seleznev was convicted in a Washington court on Thursday, on 10 counts of wire fraud, nine of obtaining information from a protected computer, nine of possession of 15 unauthorised devices, eight of intentional damage to a protected computer, and two of aggravated identity theft.
He faces a minimum of four years and a maximum of 34 years in prison when he is sentenced 2 December.
Seleznev, who used the handle Track2, scanned for vulnerable retailers across Washington and infected point of sales terminals with malware, prosecutors said.
He stole some 2.9 million credit cards, according to prosecutors, wreaking some US$169 million in damages across 3700 financial institutions.
Prosecutors said his laptop contained some 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers. ®
