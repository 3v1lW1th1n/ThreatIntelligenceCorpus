Colleagues at The Hacker News just reported that Bitcoin Cloud Mining service Cloudminr.io has been hacked and the scaring news is that the entire database is available online for sale for 1 Bitcoin.
The hackers have compromised the hosting server, accessed the database and defaced the homepage of the website.

The defaced homepage was showing a number of records from the internal database, username and unencrypted password for each user were visible on the  Cloudminr.io webpage.

The home page proposes data related to nearly 1000 Cloudminr.io users as proof of the hack, but hackers are offering the entire database composed of 80,000 records for 1 BTC. Users of Cloudminr.io mining service are at risk of fraud, criminals crews could start using the stolen data to run phishing campaigns.
At the time I was writing there are not news regarding the possible hack of Bitcoin wallets and related Bitcoin theft.
In response to the incident Cloudminr.io users are invited to change their password urgently, as usual if they share the same credentials across other web services they need to change password for them.
