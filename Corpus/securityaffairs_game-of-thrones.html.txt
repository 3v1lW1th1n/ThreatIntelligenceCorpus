Hackers leaked the fourth episode of Game of Thrones season 7 online, it is available on Vidme, Google Drive, and The Pirate Bay.
The HBO promptly shut down the Google Drive page, but the episode is still available on both the Vidme and The Pirate Bay.
The links to the episode 4 (‘The Spoils Of War’) were first shared on Reddit, then they appeared on social media torrent sites and online forums.
Legions of fans now can view the episode that sees Daenerys Targaryen finally unleash her dragons on the armies of Westeros.
It is important to highlight that this latest leak is reportedly unconnected to the recent HBO hack, which bosses slammed as ‘unsettling and disturbing’.
According to Entertainment Weekly, the episode has leaked from Star India, one of HBO’s international network partners, which receives episodes in advance of air.
“This confirms the compromise of episode 4 of Game of Thrones Season 7, earlier this afternoon. We take this breach very seriously and have immediately initiated forensic investigations at our and the technology partner’s end to swiftly determine the cause. This is a grave issue and we are taking appropriate legal remedial action.” said a Star India spokesperson.

Over the weekend, hackers leaked upcoming episodes from Ballers and Room 104 HBO TV series, they also leaked the script for episode 4 of Game of Thrones season 7, but not the actual episode.
Hollywood firms are a privileged target for hackers, in April the hacker ‘The Dark Overlord’ claimed to have stolen and leaked online episodes from the forthcoming season of the TV show Orange Is The New Black.
In May, a hacker claimed to have stolen Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, but Disney denied it.
