McAfee enlists 2e2 for BYOD security blitz
2e2, the big UK reseller, won a tasty cloud gig this week, to supply McAfee Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) as a hosted service to telcos and managed service providers.
2e2's hosted resellers will in turn offer the McAfee mobile device management software to their own customers, large and small.
Sales prospects are telcos that "can’t or don’t want to build out their own mobile management and security infrastructure," Chris Kenworthy, a senior veep at McAfee, says.
The McAfee-2e2 pitch is that end-user customers can be up and running quickly with a minimum of up-front architectural work and cost. And of course, the providers get a monthly income stream for their efforts.
Nice.
A security sales opportunity pops up with every new IT trend. And so it proves with Bring your Own Device (BYOD), the term dubbed for the proliferation of consumer devices within organisations.
Against this backdrop, securing devices at telco level is eminently sensible. Employee-owned smartphones, tablets laptops, cause a lot of scrutiny headaches for IT departments. Their bosses want iPhones and they have to figure out how to ensure that the devices are monitored and secured from the prying eyes of bad guys.
McAfee is prepping a managed services provider programme for Q3, 2012, but is not ready to share details yet. We gleaned some info for you about the service here. and it seems reasonable to infer that McAfee EMM will feature strongly in the hosted portfolio line-up. ®
