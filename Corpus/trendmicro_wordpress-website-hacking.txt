Hacked WordPress Sites: An Open Letter to WordPress Developers

The content management system WordPress is a fantastic tool. Its ease of use has has helped it become the most popular blogging tool out there. Its most recent version has been downloaded more than 5.7 million times as of this writing.
The popularity of WordPress has made it a very attractive target for cyber attackers. Like most software, eventually security holes are found that allow hackers inside. Once a site is breached, it can be used for many illegal purposes like distributing malware, hosting phishing attacks, and marketing counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Blog owners need to be ever vigilant to ensure there software is current with all updates including blog software to plug security holes.
WordPress developers have been great about patching those holes quickly. Despite being on top of vulnerabilities, there are still some steps that should not be tough to implement but should make the web a safer place.

Shopping cart software, forum software, and photo gallery software all tend to be targeted. WordPress installs are likely more common than all of those, so it would make sense to make its security a priority.
Make no mistake, we love WordPress. We use it on this very site. But there are a couple of steps that would appear to be low-hanging-fruit that Matt Mullenweg and the WordPress development crew could take to make an impact on hacked sites on the web.
