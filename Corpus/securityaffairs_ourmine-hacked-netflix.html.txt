					Ourmine hacked the Netflix’s US Twitter account					
On Wednesday, hackers belonging to the OurMine group hijacked the Netflix’s US Twitter account (@Netflix).
OurMine took over the Twitter account to promote its website. The incident is very serious, considering that the Netflix US Twitter account has 2.5 million followers. An attacker could compromise the attack to deliver malicious links and infect a huge number of followers.
OurMine is a very popular hacker group, it has hacked multiple high-profile Twitter accounts in the past. The list of victims is very long and includes Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, David Guetta Daniel Ek, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, the CEO and founder of Spotify, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and many others.
Which is the motivation?
It seems that the OurMine group is linked to a Security Firm that is trying to obtain notoriety from the attacks and is offering its services to the targets, that evidently need them to avoid further incidents.

One of the messages posted by the group states:
“We are just testing people security (sic), we never change their passwords, we did it because there is other hackers can hack them and change everything.”
Back to the hack of the Netflix’s US Twitter account, the OurMice crew posted the following message to the hacked account:
“Don’t worry we are just testing your security,” states the post.

I strongly invite you to enable two-factor authentication for any platform that supports it.
At the time I was writing this post, @Netflix was restored to normality.
I’m trying to get in contact with the Ourmine crew for an interview … stay tuned!
