How to protect yourself from phishing: 10 tips
If you think about it for a second, online phishing is not that far from actual fishing. The major difference is that the online fishermen (phishermen?) are criminals. Unlike the trout, fluke, or bass that you may fish for recreationally, the trophies that these fraudsters are after are your personal data, banking credentials, and so on.
Unfortunately there is no real cure for phishing attacks aside from paranoia-level vigilance on the case of the end user. This threat is like the flu — constantly evolving and changing attack approaches. Criminals can launch targeted phishing campaigns directed at employees of a certain organization — or expectant mothers. It’s a bit like a marketing campaign — a malicious, criminal marketing campaign.
There are numerous ways to take the bait: accessing public Wi-Fi, logging into a fake website or following a link in an e-mail promising exclusive Black Friday or Christmas deals. It’s impossible to enumerate all the cases.

In short, it’s easy to get infected. But how can users protect themselves?
