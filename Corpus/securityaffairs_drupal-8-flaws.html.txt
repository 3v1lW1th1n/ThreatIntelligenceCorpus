					Drupal addressed several vulnerabilities in Drupal 8 and 7					
Drupal maintainers have fixed many vulnerabilities in Drupal 7 and 8, including some flaws rated as “critical.”
One of the critical security vulnerabilities is related to partial cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention mechanisms that was addressed with Drupal 8.4.5 and 7.57 versions. The popular CMS uses a JavaScript function that doesn’t completely sanitize the input
“Drupal has a Drupal.checkPlain() JavaScript function which is used to escape potentially dangerous text before outputting it to HTML.” reads the advisory. “This function does not correctly handle all methods of injecting malicious HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability under certain circumstances.”

The Drupal team also fixed two moderately critical vulnerabilities in Drupal 7 and other two in Drupal 8. The flaws in Drupal 7:
