Attackers shoot to WireShark.


Every application might be vulnerable, and this is a really old concept. Nothing new, but reading that someone discovered an DoS attack to WireShark, one of the most used packet analyzer,  makes me strange.I frequently use it, during my university classes, during my external courses and also during company working time, but never I thought that it could be a potential whole in my system. That's, to me, it's a great example of what I call "Bar  Security".Following the original post:On Nov 2008, Security Vulnerability Research Team of Bkis (SVRT-Bkis) hasdetected a vulnerability underlying WireShark 1.0.4 (lastest version).The flaw is in the function processing SMTP protocol and enables hacker toperform a DoS attack by sending a SMTP request with large content to port25. The application then enter a large loop and cannot do anything else.We have contacted the vendor of Wireshark. They fixed this vulnerability forWireshark 1.0.5 but they haven't released the official version yet.
