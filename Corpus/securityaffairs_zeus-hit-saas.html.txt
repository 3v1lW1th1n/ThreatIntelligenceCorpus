This is the second news on Zeus malware in less than a week, previous one was related to a new variant using steganography to hide configuration file, this last discovery is related to a version even more sophisticated that implements a web-crawling feature.
We have been accustomed to associate the name of the feared Zeus banking trojan to the capability to target customers of financial institutions, nut this version appears  different because it has been designed to hit Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to obtain access to proprietary data or code. Software-as-a-service is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are centrally hosted on a cloud architecture. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications including Office & Messaging software, DBMS software, Development software, Virtualization and many others.
“We’ve been internally referring to this type of attack as “landmining”, since the attackers laid “landmines” on unmanaged devices used by employees to access company resources. The attackers, now bypassing traditional security measures, wait for the user to connect to *.my.salesforce.com in order to exfiltrate company data from the user’s Salesforce instance.” reported the official post issued mt Adallom.

 
The researchers noted another interesting detail, some of the Zeus parameters were hard-coded, and this and this suggests that discovered variant was used as a specially crafted tool in a larger attack. The alarming consideration is related to the possibility to replicate the attack scheme against any company using any SaaS application. 
The investigation is still on going, security  expert at Adallom Labs are working to identify responsible for the attacks and the infection vector the exploited to compromise end-user machines.
