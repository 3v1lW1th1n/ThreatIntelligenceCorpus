Quiz: Are you ready for a ransomware attack?
No one expects ransomware — until it happens. If you think it’ll never hit you, consider this: According to Kaspersky Lab data, last year ransomware hit a new victim every 10 seconds. How lucky do you feel?
We created the NoRansom website to help victims. The site hosts all of our free decryption tools and information about ransomware programs. Every Internet user should know how to protect themselves from ransomware, and also what to do in case they’re hit. NoRansom.kaspersky.com serves both purposes, providing both information and utilities. We urge everybody to visit it, although we hope you’ll never need it.
